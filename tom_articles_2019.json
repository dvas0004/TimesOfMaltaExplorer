Through this process, chocolate shrinks a bit while cooling and can, therefore, be easily removed from moulds.\nCarmelo Borg Bonaci, one of the founding members of Elia Caterers, decorating Easter eggs in the traditional way.\nTempering also gives chocolate its shine and makes it melt in the mouth but not in one\u2019s hands.\n\u201cWithout it, chocolate would not even snap,\u201d Mr Borg Bonaci notes as he splits one of the ready-made eggs to produce that cracking sound.\nDark, milk and white chocolate drops are first melted at different temperatures.

The moulds also hail from Belgium (Antwerp, to be precise) and are usually made of Teflon, polycarbonate or aluminium.\nThey come in different shapes, such as bunnies, teddy bears, ducks or more modern, abstract forms. They have various sizes, with the smallest one at Elia measuring three centimetres and the largest 80 centimetres.\nThe filled containers are placed on a vibrating tray, allowing any excess chocolate to drip off. They then pass through a cooling tunnel, a covered conveyor belt set at a specific temperature to cool down the chocolate.\nCake decorator Marica Attard filling a mould with molten chocolate.\n\u201cAll this happens in a controlled environment because temperature and humidity are the worst enemies of chocolate,\u201d Mr Borg Bonaci remarks.

He has so far refused requests to publish a 2014 Memorandum of Understanding on which he said the deal was based.\nJust a day before Parliament rose for the Christmas holidays, the minister presented it with a draft deal that had already been negotiated with Corinthia, giving the hotel chain the whole of the St George\u2019s Bay peninsula \u2013 probably one of Malta\u2019s most prized pieces of real estate \u2013 for speculation purposes.\nThe PN Opposition immediately objected to the proposed deal, which was then sent back to the drawing board.\nThe land is already in Corinthia\u2019s possession for use by its hotels exclusively. However, under the agreement that Dr Mizzi had wanted Parliament to approve in a single session, the hotel chain was to be allowed to build up to 100,000 square metres of luxury apartments and offices, which it would then put up for sale, while keeping their hotels and upgrading them.\nAmong the advantageous terms given to Corinthia, the government had agreed to take a settlement of just \u20ac17 million for the changes requested to the original 1990s agreement between the government and hotel chain \u2013 with the latter set to rake in many more millions more from its property dealings at the site.\nSectoral opposition\nThe proposed deal had created controversy and was greeted with anger by various sections of society, particularly pro-environment NGOs and the Malta Developers Association, which condemned the negotiations.\nA consortium of businessmen interested in the site warned the government it could take legal action because the sale had not been made through a public call for tenders, and because the deed, they argued, amounted to state aid in breach of EU rules.\nReal estate agents estimated the site as having a current market value of a least \u20ac700 million, way above Deloitte\u2019s valuation.\nOn the other hand, constituted bodies such as the Chamber of Commerce and Enterprise, the GRTU, Malta Employers Association and Malta Hotels and Restaurants Association had not issued a reaction, despite having harshly criticised a similar deal struck with the Seabank db Group for the former ITS site nearby.\u00a0\nDr Mizzi was also asked whether Colliers would also be asked to make a new valuation of the former ITS site, passed on to the db\u00a0Group for just \u20ac15 million after a similar Deloitte valuation, but he did not reply.\nQuestions which Konrad Mizzi did not answer:\n\u2022 In his presentation to Parliament last December, the minister defended the first valuation made by Deloitte and wanted Parliament to rubber stamp his negotiations in a session. What changed his opinion?\n\u2022 Was the first valuation wrong? Can we have a copy of the Deloitte valuation?\n\u2022 How did Minister Mizzi go to Parliament with a wrong valuation on which the whole negotiations were based?

Aren\u2019t there proper valuers in Malta who know the local current market value much better?\n\u2022 Will the government publish Collier\u2019s report when ready?\n\u2022 Will Corinthia be asked to pay market value on this deal?\n\u2022 Will Colliers also be drawing up a report on the former ITS site for a re-evaluation of the deal signed with the DB group?\nCorinthia on Colliers International:\n\u201cCorinthia works globally in real estate and has over the years been involved in projects and business involving all of the major international property consulting firms, either acting for us or advising our counter parties such as property vendors, banks and financial institutions.\n\u201cOur understanding is that government has appointed a team from Colliers in London although we cannot confirm that as we were not a party to that appointment, nor do we have knowledge or sight of the brief given to them.

In the young girl\u2019s mind, there was no doubt about what her future would hold, and that was a vocation in farming.\n\u201cClassmates could never understand me; they used to make fun of me and found farming a strange choice to make. But agriculture and livestock are in my blood. My mother\u2019s side of the family has always worked the fields and I have never wished to do anything different,\u201d she tells me, before stopping off to check how a flowering zucchini crop is faring.\nFast-forward 10 years and the now 26-year-old mother-of-two is one of a dying breed \u2013 a full-time female farmer who does the donkey work on her own, spending seven days out of seven in the fields and working as hard as the next man.\n\u201cAs soon as I finished secondary school, I started working the fields full-time, and I haven\u2019t looked back since. But to this day people still stare when they see me driving a tractor. Because I\u2019m a woman, they look at me in disgust, and most will even go so far as to tell me that women should not be doing this. Mind you, these will usually be complete strangers,\u201d she says.\nIt would appear that sexism is still very much alive when it comes to certain sectors of the industry. But Ms Spagnol is not having any of it.\n\u201cWomen are as efficient as men, and this applies to all industries. I do get those who question whether I am capable of carrying out the physical labour aspect of the job. My reply to them is that I regularly handle 300 sacks of potatoes in a morning, each sack weighing 25 kilos give or take. So there\u2019s their answer,\u201d she says with an impish smile.\nRead: The truth about antibiotics in your food\u00a0\nIn fact, what makes Ms Spagnol remarkable in the agricultural industry is not her gender; there are many women hailing from farming families working the fields in Malta. Ms Spagnol takes it a step further, with the bulk of the work divided equally between herself and her uncle.\nPeople do not understand the importance of farming\n\u201cMy husband is a livestock farmer but we keep our work separate most of the time. I spend all day, pretty much everyday, in our fields together with my uncle. He reaps the harvest and I sow the crops... or vice-versa, depending on what needs to be done.\u201d\nWhen she says she spends every day working the fields, Ms Spagnol means exactly that, with no hint of hyperbole. Every week brings with it a basic schedule from Monday to Sunday, allowing for the sometimes unexpected turn of events that Mother Nature can bring with it.\nRead: Why farmers are quitting agriculture\nShe recites her timetable matter-of-factly: \u201cMondays and Fridays I prepare the vegetables for the Farmers\u2019 Market the following day, which takes pretty much all day. Tuesdays and Saturdays I\u2019m at the Farmers\u2019 Market in Ta\u2019 Qali at 5am sharp. Wednesdays and Thursdays I plant the crops, water them and so forth...\u201d And on the seventh day, the farmer rested? No.\nThe last \u2018holiday\u2019 was when I gave birth to my daughter.\n\u201cThere\u2019s always something to do on Sundays too, you know. There\u2019s always watering, unexpected problems, new crops to plant... the fields are a 24-7 job.\u201d\nSo, when does she get to have a rest and maybe holiday a bit? This question provokes peals of laughter. The answer to that, clearly, is very rarely.\n\u201cI haven\u2019t been abroad in 10 years. Since I started working full-time, in fact. I\u2019ve forgotten what it means to visit another country. As for rest I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t sleep much that\u2019s for sure. Sometimes I\u2019m still watering crops at 8pm. The only days I try to keep sacred and work-free are Christmas and New Year\u2019s Day.\u201d\nShe stops to think for a second, and adds, as an afterthought: \u201cCome to think of it, the last \u2018holiday\u2019 was when I gave birth to my daughter. Mostly because it was by Caesarian section, so I had to stop for a couple of days whether I liked it or not. Otherwise, I wouldn\u2019t have been away from the fields for that long, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d\nRead: 'This generation thinks carrots grow in supermarkets'\nHow does this work out with taking care of a two-year-old and a nine-month-old, I wonder out loud. This provokes another peal of laughter.\n\u201cWhat did I say about women being as capable as men, earlier? I\u2019d hazard to add that we are even more capable in some instances. I multi-task like there\u2019s no tomorrow. Parents help with the babysitting aspect, of course, we all need that little bit of help on occasion. But I\u2019m there to oversee the kids\u2019 homework, to spend time with them and put them to bed. Not that there haven\u2019t been days when I\u2019ve had to nip down to the fields for some emergency watering or general upkeep at night, mind you. But I still get to spend time with them.\u201d\nAlexandra Spagnol\u2019s last \u2018holiday\u2019 was when she gave birth. Video: Chris Sant Fournier\nThe young farmer\u2019s fields cover a various array of crops \u2013 she exports potatoes to the Dutch market; she grows any veggies you can think of, such as kale, tomatoes, onions, zucchini... She is currently planning to experiment with asparagus, despite the knowledge that it\u2019s a big gamble and that the plants take about two years to flourish.\nShe also makes the ever-popular \u0121bejniet, thanks to a herd of goats that she keeps in a separate field.\n\u201cThey are one of the main reasons why I can\u2019t really take a day off, more so than the crops. My uncle would cover for me in the fields for a couple of days, but with livestock you can\u2019t do that. They get very attached to the person who feeds them everyday and tend to shy away from new people. This affects the yield, of course. They love me; the family always jokes that you can easily figure out which part of the fields I\u2019m standing in, as there will be all the goats right behind me.\u201d\nThe goats are also used to her little ones, she adds, particularly her son, who already has an affinity for the land and for livestock.\n\u201cHe loves it. He is exactly like I was at his age, wanting to spend every single spare minute of the day in the fields, on the tractor or with the animals. And they are used to him, they love him back,\u201d she says with a proud smile.\nThis begs the question: given all this hardship, how does she feel about a future in farming for her children? It is easy to see that my question produces mixed reactions, that the young mother is torn between pride and caution.\nPeople stare in disapproval when they see me driving a tractor\n\u201cI love the land, so of course I feel proud that my offspring seem to love it just as much. At the same time, it would set my mind at rest to see them with a \u2018normal\u2019 job, and a secure paycheque every month.\n\u201cIt is not so much the hardship that makes me cautious. Farmers are used to that. It\u2019s the lack of appreciation, the assumptions that we are rolling in money when it\u2019s anything but the case. The system is stacked against us,\u201d she says, a reference to the way that the infamous Pitkali market operates as well as to the fact that Maltese consumers nowadays do not attach value to local produce.\n\u201cI\u2019ve almost stopped using the Pitkali; the Farmers\u2019 Market has been a game-changer for me. I prefer to deal directly with the consumer, anyway. The feeling of satisfaction of actually selling something that you yourself nurtured is incomparable.\u201d\nBut even this is not without a downside. Customers are increasingly reluctant to pay a reasonable amount for produce and expect local farmers to sell their crops at a much lower price than imported fruit and vegetables that are found at supermarkets.\n\u201cPeople will not negotiate at a supermarket, of course. But they continuously haggle with me, when I\u2019m already charging rock bottom prices. When you consider the expenses involved in farming, if you do the math you will figure out that we\u2019re not rich pretty fast,\u201d she insists.\nThe expenses don\u2019t only include the obvious capital expenditures for crops and equipment but also the unexpected disasters wrought by nature. This year, Ms Spagnol tells me, was particularly cruel, with the weather acting up from one extreme to another.\n\u201cSo many crops destroyed, and we have to foot the bill for everything. There was a lot of rain and wind this year, but also a lot of \u0121lada.\u201d\n\u0120lada, she explains, is a thin layer of ice that forms over the crops when the air is particularly cold. The result typically tends to be a field full of dead plants.\n\u201cWhen it\u2019s a particularly cloudless day in winter, we can tell immediately what\u2019s going to happen later at night. We usually go down to the fields at around 9pm to hose down the crops in order to melt down the ice,\u201d she explains.\nWriting that it\u2019s a tough life is somewhat redundant, but Ms Spagnol repeats that the hardships don\u2019t really bother her as much as some people\u2019s attitudes.\n\u201cAt school they used to make fun of me for wanting to be a farmer. In all truth, not much has changed now. People remain uneducated about agriculture and what it entails. And they still do not understand the importance of a Maltese farming industry.

Other reasons were mentioned but they all obtained less than five per cent of mentions.\nFloating voters\nTwo other questions indicate the extent to which respondents may switch from one party to another between elections.\nForty-two per cent of respondents consider themselves as floating voters. The incidence of floating voters is higher among those aged under 55 and among males, and least in the south-eastern region of Malta.\nSixteen per cent of those who intend voting for the Nationalist Party in the forthcoming EP elections consider themselves to be floating voters, while this is true for 28 per cent of those intending to vote Labour.\nSeven per cent of all respondents claimed to regret the way they voted in the 2017 general election.\nAround half of these claimed to have voted for the Labour Party while a quarter of them claimed to have voted for the Nationalists. The other quarter did not state who they voted for.\nLeaders of the pack\nWhile 59 per cent of respondents are still undecided whom to vote for, 29 per cent of Labour voters named Miriam Dalli as their preferred candidate and 16 per cent named Alfred Sant. The other PL candidates all received a minimal number of mentions.\u00a0\nAmong Nationalist voters, the top two were Roberta Metsola, at 21 per cent, and Frank Psaila, with 12 per cent.

Similarly, women and persons who are not working are also less concerned about this issue.\nTraffic is seen as the most important issue by persons aged under 25, followed by too much construction work and the environment.\nCorruption increases in importance as one moves up the age groups, while the environment tends to get more important the younger the respondents.\u00a0\nFor declared Labour voters, immigration and traffic are the major issues, both mentioned by 23 per cent of PL respondents.\nFor declared PN voters, corruption and immigration are by far the major issues, mentioned by 32 per cent and 31 per cent respectively.\nAmong those that consider themselves as floating voters, 31 per cent consider immigration to be the major issue followed by traffic, mentioned by 21 per cent of such respondents.\nFinances a major personal challenge\nAlso unprompted, survey respondents were then asked to state what they consider to be the two major personal challenges they are facing. Personal financial issues (low income, cost of living, low pension) topped the list, mentioned by 25 per cent of respondents. This represents a big rise from a Misco survey two years ago, when 14 per cent of respondents mentioned financial issues as their major personal challenge.\nTraffic was mentioned by 17 per cent (up from 10 per cent in 2017).\nThis was followed by a \u201cstressful lifestyle\u201d at six per cent and the cost of property, also six per cent.\nThe stressful lifestyle and cost of property declines in importance as one moves up the age groups.\nThis is the first time, however, that \u201cstressful lifestyle\u201d has made it into the list of personal challenges.\nAmong declared PN voters, personal financial issues are by far the most often mentioned challenge, at 47 per cent.\nOn the other hand, declared Labour voters see traffic as their major challenge (20 per cent).\nParties\u2019 platforms\nRespondents were also asked to identify the main issues which they believe the main political parties are talking about.\nWhen it comes to the Nationalist Party, 12 per cent said it is talking mainly about corruption, 5.9 per cent thought it was personal financial issues and two per cent said immigration. Fifty-six per cent didn\u2019t know.\nAs regards the Labour Party, a range of issues were mentioned.
