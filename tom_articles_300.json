This suggests that Malta\u2019s Family Court decisions are causing unnecessary harm to public health.\nOne of the world\u2019s foremost specialists in children\u2019s wellbeing after marital separation has told The Sunday Times of Malta that \u201cfamily law needs to evolve\u201d to protect children\u2019s health after family breakdown.\nWilliam Fabricius, a psychology professor at Arizona State University in the US, was speaking after publication of his latest research paper last week by the UK\u2019s Oxford University Press.\u00a0\nThe paper \u2013 \u2018Equal Parenting Time: The Case for Legal Presumption\u2019 \u2013 builds on research carried out over the past 20 years into the post-separation living arrangements for children and the ramifications on their health.\nIt has long been established that children of broken families are at higher risk of mental illness, educational underachievement, social maladjustment and poor health. These effects have become a public health concern given the soaring rates of family breakdowns worldwide \u2013 in Malta, extrapolation of statistics shows that now, more than a third of marriages split.\nThe latest wave of research shows that, rather than the separation itself, it is the post-separation living arrangements enforced or facilitated by family courts that are largely to blame for potential deleteriousness on children. Those arrangements include the placement of the children with one parent, normally the mother, technically known as SPC (sole physical custody).\nLeading scientists now maintain that JPC (joint physical custody) \u2013 popularly known as shared parenting or shared care \u2013 is itself a \u2018buffer\u2019 against the impact of separation on children\u2019s health.\nThe scientific underpinnings of JPC and its design were detailed in a 22-page blueprint drafted by 110 leading experts and published by the American Psychological Association in the journal Psychology, Public Policy, and Law five years ago. It has been endorsed by the Council of Europe, which passed a resolution calling on member states, including Malta, to make shared parenting the foundation of family law.\nIn shared parenting, each parent, post-separation, gets more or less equal care-time with children and each remains integrally involved in the children\u2019s upbringing.\nThis has now spawned a social and celebrity movement, as well as apps, under the buzzword of \u2018coparenting\u2019.\nMalta\u2019s Agenzija Appo\u0121\u0121 has been holding courses in coparenting for separated parents since 2017.\nOutdated family courts\nConsultations with specialist lawyers show that Malta remains behind the curve: joint physical custody remains an anathema for Malta\u2019s family courts. The law allows wide judicial discretion and case-law has evolved to strongly favour sole physical custody assigned to mothers.\n\u201cThe Family Court feels that children should be with the mother,\u201d says Marion Camilleri, a lawyer with 15 years of experience in that court. \u201cSo unless something is faulty with the mother, the mother gets to raise the children and the father has access.\u201d\nThe standard \u201caccess\u201d is set at two hours on two weekday afternoons and a cycle of 24 hours on the weekend. That amounts to 16 per cent of the time, less than half the 35 per cent threshold set by social scientists for the secondary or nonresident parent in the JPC model (see box).\nIn much of the Western world most children still get similarly assigned to the mother. But the momentum towards shared parenting in recent years has made Malta a laggard.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe countries leading the way have forged a variety of models. Australia pioneered a decade-long process that has fostered JPC. Canada last year tweaked the law to make it more parent-neutral, excising terms such as \u201caccess\u201d that encourage litigation, and the courts have begun to assign equal parenting time. Half of US states now have laws in effect or in draft that favour JPC. In Europe there is currently a JPC law in the works in Italy, and German courts are more equitable towards the parents and scientific in their procedures, often involving social workers in decision-making.\u00a0\nMichel Grangeat, professor at France\u2019s University Grenoble Alpes, told The Sunday Times of Malta that the \u201clatest survey shows that the rate of equal shared parenting has doubled from 2010 to 2016\u201d. It now stands at almost one in five post-separation arrangements, which \u201cdemonstrates a strong momentum in shared parenting dissemination in France\u201d.\u00a0\nMichael Lewkowicz of the NGO Families Need Fathers said that although the law in the UK pronounces that shared parenting is best for children, \u201cwe have a very high rate of single parenting and that is partially because of the deficiencies of family justice and social justice\u201d.\nFamily law needs to evolve\n\u201cThe chances of getting an equal placement order in court is less than 20 per cent,\u201d Mr Lewkowiczsaid. \u201cMany judges still operate on the traditional idea of the mother providing care and the father financial means. We need a presumption in law on shared care.\u201d\nLegal \u2018presumption\u2019\nScientists and campaigners have made the \u2018legal presumption\u2019 their destination: to legally oblige family courts to impose JPC on couples litigating for custody unless contraindicated by circumstances of any particular case. It is also known as the \u201crebuttable presumption\u201d because SPC would remain the fallback option if one of the parents is abusive, negligent, violent or suffers from mental or other incapacity that could damage the child.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nLegal presumption has been entrenched in law in Belgium and Sweden in Europe, and in four US states. Yet many legislators remain opposed to the legal presumption, fearing that it would restrict courts\u2019 leeway in cases that fall in the grey area.\nMany fathers seem resigned to the fact that it\u2019s the mother who\u2019s going to get the children.\nEdward Kruk, professor of social work at Canada\u2019s University of British Columbia, last year made an exhaustive case for legal presumption in a paper in the Journal of Divorce and Remarriage. It was also adopted by 12 expert panelists last November at the International Conference on Shared Parenting held under the auspices of the Council of Europe.\nRELATED STORIESWhat defines an 'unfit parent'?\nProfessor of psychology at Cambridge University and prolific researcher Michael Lamb had said that \u201con the basis of this evidence, social scientists can now cautiously recommend presumptive shared parenting to policymakers.\u201d\nIn last week\u2019s paper, Prof. Fabricius wrote that \u201cfailure to enact presumptions of equal parenting time risks unnecessary harm to children\u2019s emotional security with their parents, and consequently unnecessary harm to public health in the form of long-term stress-related mental and physical health problems among children of divorce.\u201d\nMalta\u2019s cultural drag\nProf. Fabricius wrote that family law tends to reflect cultural sensibilities on parenting. This may partly explain Malta\u2019s laggardness \u2013 parenting roles remain traditionally binary across wide swathes of Maltese society.\nIn his expanded comments, Prof. Fabricius clarified that \u201cvaluing fathers\u2019 importance in daily childcare is one of the big cultural attitude changes in our generation. Public opinion is in favour of equal parenting time, and it\u2019s the family law that needs to evolve.\u201d\nDr Camilleri says that \u201cwhen fathers ask me to represent them \u2013 and I do represent many fathers \u2013 I ask them if they want to take care of the children. Many respond that \u2018it\u2019s the mother who always took care of the children and accept that this arrangement shall endure. Many fathers also feel that the family court is biased against fathers, and seem resigned to the fact that it\u2019s the mother who\u2019s going to get the children.\u201d\nCouples are legally obliged to go for \u2018mediation\u2019 at the Family Court before escalating to a full-scale lawsuit. The mediator\u2019s role is to hold the ring and lead the couple to amicable settlement, but according to specialist lawyers the spirit of mediation is often marred by temporary court orders on child maintenance and access.\n\u201cMany times one of the parties files an application requesting rulings during the mediation process itself, sometimes even before the mediation starts, and judges make provisional rulings on child maintenance and access,\u201d Dr Camilleri said, adding that these judicial decisions create bearings or points of reference in the mediation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a double-edged sword,\u201d she says. \u201cOn the one hand mediation can run for months and even years, and judges feel compelled to make interim rulings so as not to disadvantage any of the parties. On the other hand these provisional decrees set parameters that interfere with the spirit of mediation, which is to allow the parties themselves to freely reach agreement.\u201d\nIn these \u201cprovisional\u201d rulings, the Family Court tends to lay the parameters for SPC assigned to the mother even before anyone files a lawsuit.\nThe judiciary even remains sceptical of JPC agreed directly between the parents, and reluctant to endorse JPC contracts for young children.\n\u201cJudges tend to be wary of contracts in which there is no assigned residence, no child maintenance provisions, and no defined access,\u201d Dr Camilleri said, \u201calthough recently I have heard other lawyers say that judges have begun to accept shared parenting contracts.\u201d\nThe caseload in Malta\u2019s Family Court keeps swelling; a third full-time judge was appointed last year.\nBy contrast, Sweden\u2019s downward rate is often attributed to the entrenchment of JPC. Less than two per cent of couples that split now litigate in Sweden.\nSweden\u2019s rate of shared parenting \u2013 upward of 40 per cent \u2013 is the highest in the world. Yet in another sense, this demonstrates that one of the parents still opts out of involved parenting, or moves away, in half of separations.\nScience-law chasm\nThere is a disconnect between social science and the legal profession in Malta. Like her peers, Dr Camilleri expresses scepticism towards the practicality of shared parenting. The prevailing idea in the family law community is that living out of two homes is chaotic, impractical and does not engender stability in children\u2019s lives.\nIn contrast, scientists hold that children\u2019s emotional security or stability is served in JPC. This was illustrated in a Swedish study involving 172,391 children titled Fifty Moves A Year. The study found no statistical difference in mental health manifestations of children in intact families and JPC, but more psychosomatic symptoms in SPC children.\nProf. Fabricius, who was involved in the development of America\u2019s first shared-parenting law in 2013, wrote about the legal profession\u2019s evolution from initial scepticism to eventual embrace of JPC. He wrote that although the law doesn\u2019t specify JPC \u2013 it states that \u201cabsent evidence to the contrary, it is in a child\u2019s best interest to have substantial, frequent, meaningful and continuing parental time with both parents\u201d and that \u201cthe court shall adopt a parenting plan that maximizes respective parenting time\u201d \u2013 it has decidedly fostered JPC in Arizona\u2019s family courts.\u00a0\nAsked by The Sunday Times of Malta what shifted attitudes in the legal profession, he said: \u201cI think education made the difference. The family law community in Arizona was kept informed about new research findings for several years, and by the time the new law was proposed there was essentially no resistance.\u201d\nWhat the science says\nJohn Bowlby\u2019s 1969 theory of monotropy, which held that children form a primary attachment to their chief carer, created the understanding that children would be harmed if they spend extended periods away from the mother, particularly overnights. Bowlby later said that the primary attachment could be to any of the parents.\u00a0\nLater research found that children develop equal simultaneous attachments to the two parents at around six months of age.\nAt the same time, studies of the initial wave of children who grew up in SPC showed that meaningful father absence can mar children\u2019s development and psychological outcomes.\u00a0\nScience now holds that marital breakdown threatens children\u2019s \u201cemotional security\u201d, and that maintaining post-separation quality relationship with both parents is a buffer to emotional insecurity.\u00a0\nQuality relationships \u2013 a measure of parental warmth, involvement in children\u2019s activities and effective discipline \u2013 can only develop if the parent has sufficient time with the child. The scientific threshold of \u2018sufficient time\u2019 has been fixed at 35 per cent of the time.\nThe least-involved parent in\u00a0 the JPC model has to have at least 35 per cent of the parenting time, including overnights (essential for development of quality relationship).\nLinda Nielson, a US professor of Adolescent and Education Psychology who last year reviewed all 60 studies that compared JPC and SPC, concluded that \u201cindependent of family income, the level of conflict between the parents, the quality of their relationships with each parent, and quality of the parenting skills, JPC children are still generally more advantaged.\u201d", "comment_count": 1, "id": 1630}, {"keywords": "Accident, Marsaxlokk, Beach", "author": "", "article_body": "Updated at 9.40pm\nA man was found floating in the water at St Peter\u2019s Pool on Sunday afternoon and pronounced dead at the scene, the police said.\nThe man was spotted by bathers at the popular Marsaxlokk seaside spot at around 4pm.

He sat down with Vanessa Macdonald to explain the rationale.\nIsn\u2019t the law a knee-jerk reaction? Entities have been asking for laws to be revised for years.\nThere was a process under way to consolidate the building codes, and meetings were already being held. After the third collapse, we got the 2013 legal notice on third party properties\u2026\nWhy did you wait till the third building collapse? Why didn\u2019t you do something after the first?\nWe were already reviewing the law but then we accelerated the process to do \u2013 in one week \u2013 what had to be done. This stop-gap measure is not meant to be the final document but the government wanted to tackle the issues that emerged from the 2013 legal notice.\nThe main issue was the method statement, which was not previously clearly defined as it is now. It is now much more onerous \u2013 I think too onerous and maybe should be toned down if it emerges that some clauses are not necessary. A site manager was required by law (in terms of third party rights) to ensure that the method statement \u2013 which is by its very nature very complicated \u2013 was followed.\nWe are now being much more prescriptive about their role and responsibilities. Until last Monday, anyone could be a site manager.\nAnd now you have gone to the other extreme and said it could only be an architect\u2026\nThe government is already on record as saying that at any point in time the minister could consider other competences, and engineers could be included.\nThere are thousands of construction projects under way at the moment. Are there enough architects and engineers to do this, or will we effectively end up with less on-site surveillance? Will it actually make things safer?\nNot all projects require a site technical officer (STO). The schedule in the legal notice makes it very clear where they are required: when there is excavation, demolition or construction that impacts third parties.\nThe site manager was there to look after the developer/owner\u2019s interest. That was changed and the contractor now appoints the STO. Yet, they are the ones most likely to take shortcuts. Isn\u2019t there a conflict of interest?\nThe STO will be a warranted person and their first loyalty is to the warrant. And the contractor is already bound by other health and safety regulations to have a set-up, to have well-trained workers, certified lifting equipment, a risk assessment in place and so on. I see this as a way to make contractors more aware of their obligations.\nJust as there are lawyers and notaries who are bad apples in spite of their warrant, there could be architects who might succumb to pressure from the person who is appointing them\u2026\nThere are bad apples in all sectors in every level in society. You need to draft the law on the assumption that all warrant-holders are acting in good faith. There are fora where if there is negligence or, worse, voluntary commission, then procedures will be put in motion. An STO is now obliged by law to halt works if the method statement is not being followed, it is very clear.\nIf an STO closes their eyes to something, the implications are much more serious, which is why we put in much harsher deterrents. An omission would previously have carried a \u20ac500 fine, now increased to \u20ac10,000.\nUntil last Monday, anyone could be a site manager\nIf works persist in spite of an enforcement notice, the fine has shot up from \u20ac1,200 to \u20ac50,000. You have to see the law in a wider dimension. But I reiterate that the Kamra tal-Periti [Chamber of Architects] is right on this point: contractors should be aware of their obligations from the Health and Safety Act and they must have a competent person on site to monitor what is going on.\nThe abrupt introduction of this legal notice caused havoc, bringing everything to a halt. Was it necessary?\nWe could have had a repeat of what happened a few weeks ago, and who would then take responsibility for delays? It had to be seen in the context of public safety. Is any other conclusion possible?\nAnd what about the tremendous increase in costs? Are they justified?\nIt is \u2013 theoretically \u2013 possible that some of the method statements already done were not sufficient to ensure safety. So they now need to be standardised. And architects need to submit them to the Planning Authority, rather than to the Building Regulation Office.\nRELATED STORIESThe periti go marching on - Sandro Spiteri\nThe BRO was supposed by law to publish them on its site but never did so.\nIndeed, there was no traceability. Now the method statement has to follow the rules and must be published so that all stakeholders have access to it and have two weeks in which to object. This is a new concept.\nI can\u2019t say this will guarantee that there are no accidents in the future but I think it is a step in the right direction. You cannot eliminate risks but you have to minimise them.\nWhat happens to the current site managers? Are they all out of a job, unless they happen to be architects or engineers?\nBe careful to distinguish between STOs dealing with complex method statements and project managers. The latter are there to make sure that works are delivered on time\u2026 They are not affected by this law.\nLecturer Ruben Paul Borg had said in a recent Times Talk edition that concrete buildings should be assessed as concrete has a lifespan of 35-40 years.\nIn fact, the schedules actually say that a range of tests must be done before construction commences, reflecting what he said. This assessment is now an obligation.\nAny project is only as strong as its weakest link. Masons have to be licensed. The list has finally been published. There is no ID card given. And do you know that there are people on that list who are dead?\nVery good point. Before I could authorise the start of works, as an architect I had to certify that it would be overseen by a licensed mason, who had to sign the commencement notice. It would be my obligation to ensure that they have a valid licence.\nThe Kamra tal-Periti rightly insisted on the list being made public\u2026 in reality, I agree with many of its arguments and they are definitely acting in good faith, even if we remain at odds over some points.\nI want to make it clear that I salute the current president who is a very dedicated, decent and competent woman.\nI agree that some of the details on that list need to be improved. There are even people on that list who got licensed some time ago but did not renew it. Infrastructure Minister Ian Borg already decided to look into this.\nIt is good to see that awareness is improving and that something good will come out of this.\nAgain, a law is only as good as its enforcement.

Ivan Martin goes over the main changes for landlords and tenants alike.\nThe rent reform seeks to incentivise landlords to enter into long-term rental agreements by offering them hundreds of euros in tax credits. This, the government hopes, will help provide more security for tenants, in a market that is characterised by widespread abuse and skyrocketing prices.\nThe reform will introduce a mandatory one-year minimum contract for long-lets, with financial incentives for landlords who provide a two-year and a three-year-or-more agreement.\nAnnual rental increases will be capped at five per cent, but only in multi-year contracts.\nNothing, however, will stop landlords from entering into one-year contracts and drastically increasing the rental price for the next one-year agreement.\nWhile the price will still be set by the free market, landlords will now be bound to provide tenants with at least three months of notice if they plan to evict them.\nIf a tenant is not informed of the landlord\u2019s wishes prior to this period then the contract will be automatically extended for another year.\nOn the flipside, tenants will now have to meet a mandatory minimum period of rental before being able to leave a contract.\nFor one-year contracts this will be two months, for two-year agreements it will be four months, and for three-year contracts it will be six months.\u00a0\nTenants will also be required to provide a notice period should they wish to vacate the property before the termination of the contract.\nShort-let contracts, which will be set at a six-month maximum duration, can only be provided to non-resident workers and non-resident students. No fiscal incentives will be available for these landlords.\nThe reform is currently being discussed in parliament and the government expects it to come into force by January. However,\u00a0 a transitory amnesty period will allow for the sector to get used to the new system.\u00a0\nRegistering rent contracts\nAll residential rental agreements will have to be registered with the authorities, in a bid to cut down on black market abuse that pervades the industry.\nThe register, which will also be online and run on blockchain, will be overseen by the Housing Authority.\u00a0\nFailure to register will mean a fine ranging from \u20ac2,500 to \u20ac10,000\nLandlords will have to submit the contractual agreement, the inventory of the entire property, and the deposit paid, into the new system.\nShould an agreement not meet the necessary criteria, it will not be registered, and will instead be flagged.\nCracking down\nAccording to the team that drafted the reform, to date Malta\u2019s rental market is characterised by widespread black market abuse. Under the new system, if a landlord fails to register their property, they will be subject to a fine ranging from \u20ac2,500 to \u20ac10,000.\u00a0\nTenants will also be encouraged to flag irregularities or suspicions to the Housing Authority.\nA beefed-up Housing Authority will be empowered to investigate the market. The authority will also be able to take a case before a new Rent Regulation Board on behalf of the tenant and demand an imposition of three-year leases at 75 per cent of the property\u2019s market value. This would provide security for tenants who to date fear being made homeless if they report landlords who rent on the black market.\nA new adjudicating panel for residential rentals will be set up and composed of legal and technical experts.\u00a0 It will deal with disputes related to deposits or maintenance fees of no more than \u20ac5,000.\nClaims will be resolved within five working days.\nProtection for landlords\nThe courts will be empowered to announce an eviction on its first hearing, putting an end of the endless delays landlords sometimes have to put up with before they get their property back.\nLandlords will also have the right to demand compensation for any additional months the tenant might stay beyond a contract, without having to open fresh court proceedings.\nUtilities\nTenants will now be given access to water and electricity bills to ensure that they only pay for the amount they consume.\nLandlords will be duty bound to provide access to the billing information for the provision of utilities so that tenants will no longer have to take the property owner\u2019s word on how much was due.\u00a0\nAlso utility providers will no longer suspend the provision of water and electricity in cases were either tenants or landlords are disputing the amount due.\u00a0\nAirbnb and tourist rentals\nThis reform does not have anything to do with the holiday rental market and tourism rentals such as Airbnb, which will be covered in another law being drafted.", "comment_count": 10, "id": 1636}, {"keywords": "Crime, Court, Family", "author": "", "article_body": "A 31-year-old man from Qormi was remanded in custody on Sunday after pleading not guilty to assaulting his parents during a row that got out of hand.\nThe court, presided over by Magistrate Joe Mifsud, heard how the altercation between Keith Agius and his parents happened at their Qormi residence on Saturday.

The court heard that just a month after the woman had moved into her son\u2019s home, he informed his siblings that their mother had given him full power of attorney to manage her estate.\nCourt ordered rescission of the contract of donation on grounds of deceit and the return of the funds with interests\nHis siblings found it strange since their mother had always wanted two of them to manage her estate, to ensure there was an element of control.\nThe court heard how Mr Camilleri carefully planned the signing of the deed of donation to ensure the fewest possible hurdles. He contacted the notary a while before and prepared all the groundwork for the signing to proceed as smoothly as possible.\nMs Camilleri told the court that she never intended to donate all her property to her son since she loved her five children equally and wanted all her estate and life savings to be distributed equally.\nShe said her son had told her that he needed to take her to the notary to confirm the will she had signed with her late husband. She said she had specifically asked whether the inheritance agreement would still stand and had been given assurances.\nThe court found that the version of events given by Giuseppa Camilleri was credible as it was also corroborated by other evidence including the testimony of psychiatrist Joseph Vella Baldacchino.\nHe testified that when Mr Camilleri had taken his mother to his clinic for an examination just before the contract, the deed of donation was never mentioned.\nIt also resulted that soon after the contract of donation, Mr Camilleri had gone to the local HSBC branch and used the power of attorney to withdraw practically all his mother\u2019s savings leaving her with a balance of only \u20ac33 in her bank account.\nThe court found that the Camilleri couple gave conflicting versions, including on why the money had been withdrawn.\nThey claimed that this was to compensate them for services rendered but it resulted that they were already in receipt of the mother\u2019s pension. Furthermore, nobody is entitled to compensate himself unilaterally without court approval, the court noted. \u00a0\nThe Court of Appeal presided over by Chief Justice Joseph Azzopardi, Mr Justice Tonio Mallia and Mr Justice Joseph Micallef rejected the appeal filed by the son and his wife, also throwing out their plea that their mother was not in a mental position to fight the court case.\nThe court ordered the rescission of the contract of donation on grounds of deceit and the return of all the elderly mother\u2019s funds with interests and costs against the defendants.\u00a0\nSeparate proceedings against the couple filed by Catherine Pace, who suffered the same fate as her sister Giuseppa Camilleri, are still pending.\nLawyer Paul Cachia represented Giuseppa Camilleri.\u00a0", "comment_count": 0, "id": 1643}, {"keywords": "Banking, Finance", "author": "Ivan Martin", "article_body": "The financial services watchdog has raised \u201cserious concerns\u201d about Bank of Valletta\u2019s operational and managerial processes, giving it until Friday to agree to implement a hefty overhaul, a leaked letter has revealed.\nIn a stern letter sent to BOV by the Malta Financial Services Authority last week, the bank\u2019s senior management was taken to task for not showing the \u201crequired sense of urgency\u201d to get its house in order.\u00a0\nThe European Central Bank reviewed BOV back in March, and officials were in Malta last week for a follow-up, however the result of these visits has so far remained under wraps.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe Sunday Times of Malta is informed that an onsite inspection by the ECB had flagged around a dozen cases of \u201coperational risk\u201d at Malta\u2019s biggest bank, four of which were deemed critical.\nThe MFSA letter warns BOV that the European Banking Authority could potentially move to downgrade it if remedial action is not taken soon.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cDespite various interactions, [the bank] is perceived as lacking in effectively addressing the spirit as well as the actual concerns raised, and does not show the required sense of urgency expected in these circumstances to address the issues at hand,\u201d the letter reads.\nThe MFSA told the bank\u2019s management that BOV had issues when it came to taking on new clients, and \u201cmajor deficiencies\u201d when it came to the effectiveness of its internal governance.

53, withdrew more than \u20ac30,000, sold her mother's bonds and stocks and racked up bills at beauty salons, supermarkets and a hotel.\nShe was jailed and ordered to return the cash and

\u20ac30,000 from her bank accounts.\nThe mother-of-eight, together with four of her adult children, subsequently reported that Ms Grech had also arbitrarily sold stocks and bonds belonging to her parent, while refusing to return the family\u2019s gold heirloom entrusted into her possession following a rise in charges on bank safety deposit boxes.\nThe suspected swindler had persisted in her ways even after being informed that her mother had ordered the \u201cimmediate\u201d revocation of the power of attorney, five days before being turned out of her mother\u2019s home where she had resided together with her husband up to 2015.\nCriminal action was instituted against the woman for misappropriation over a 12-month period between 2014 and 2015.\nConflicting versions of events\nIn the course of the proceedings, two conflicting versions emerged.\nOn the one hand, the accused insisted that she had always acted on her mother's instructions, that she had withdrawn money to be shared among all siblings and that the valuables were being held in exchange of personal belongings she had left behind at her mother\u2019s home when ordered out.\nOn the other hand, there was the testimony of other witnesses, including the damning proof put forward by the \"lucid and eloquent\" elderly lady.\nThe accused\u2019s version, riddled with inconsistencies, \u201clies and tales\u201d, was far-stretched and lacking in credibility, the Court, presided over by magistrate Donatella Frendo Dimech, observed.\nWhile insisting that she had handed over the money to her mother to be divided between all siblings, the latter had not received \u201ca single penny\u201d.\n\u201cShe took the bonds and everything,\u201d the mother had testified, \u201cShe did not borrow, she stole.\u201d\nHer

payments at various supermarkets, a hotel, a beauty salon and other retail outlets had been with her mother\u2019s blessing.\nOver \u20ac25,000 had been withdrawn in 48 hours, while there had been regular withdrawals varying between \u20ac100 and \u20ac500 from the ATM at the Birkirkara Civic Centre, making up a lump sum of \u20ac30,466.25, the Court went on.\nRepeated calls by her mother and siblings to return the general and special power of attorney, had gone unheeded, the Court noted.\nThe evidence showed that the accused had taken over her mother\u2019s bank accounts, made free use of her bank card to fuel her personal expenditure, arbitrarily sold her mother\u2019s stocks and bonds, subsequently withdrawing the funds and kept refusing to hand over the family valuables even when asked to do so by the Court.\nSuch wrongdoing had landed her elderly mother in a situation where she could not afford to seek care at a home, where she had wished to spend the final years of her life,

The area has a high cultural and historical value,characterised by a cluster of buildings forming a hamlet already visible in 1908, which is marked by the Mensija Sanctuary and the Lanzun Tower, both scheduled at Grade 1.According to the Superintendence of Cultural Heritage, the site is located just 200 metres from the Mensija cart ruts, another site of archaeological importance.\u201cThere is a risk that development in the area may pose a threat to known and unknown cultural heritage.

If we push for quotas on women, those women would have to constantly legitimise their position. We need to curtail men\u2019s over-representation in politics because we\u2019re bringing in mediocre men,\u201d JosAnn Cutajar said, quoting French gender politics expert Rainbow Murray.\u00a0I know women who take off their wedding rings to ensure they are not treated as potential mums\nShe was speaking during a business breakfast titled \u2018Equality is not a women\u2019s issue alone, it\u2019s a men\u2019s issue too\u2019. The event was organised by Women Directors in Malta, an organisation that seeks to help women make the right connections to get to board level.\u00a0\nI know women who take off their wedding rings to ensure they are not treated as potential mums\nDr Cutajar \u2013 who is also the chair of the Consultative Council for Woman\u2019s Rights within the Ministry for European Affairs and Equality \u2013 was sharing insights from her current project that involves an audit of political parties.\n\u201cIf parties don\u2019t change, we won\u2019t have change. It\u2019s the party, the leaders, that push candidates. When we speak about quotas for women, people say it\u2019s not meritocratic. We are saying: push the best men and women forward. With too many men the talent pool is affected,\u201d she said stressing that this applied to all minority group representations. The result of this misrepresentation, she cautioned, was alienating voters.\nJust 10 out of Malta\u2019s 67 MPs are women, making the country an EU laggard when it comes to gender parity in political participation. In March, the government unveiled plans to\u00a0increase women\u2019s participation in politics. Rather than direct gender quotas, the government is proposing to raise the number of MPs by up to 12 more seats to ensure gender parity. The proposed measure is gender-neutral and applicable to any gender with less than 40 per cent representation.\nTransparent selection criteria\nDr Cutajar elaborated that, as research showed, men start out at an advantage in politics: They benefit from the assumption that they are competent because they are men, criteria for access are based on previous male role models, and their traits and qualifications are seldom subject to close scrutiny.\u00a0\n\u201cWe need transparent, objective criteria that constitute good representation,\u201d she said. At the moment, when selecting candidates, political parties are more interested in how much time the candidate has, how much money they have to run a campaign, their charisma, ability to woo the crowd and party loyalty. The qualities of a good politician should include intelligence, honesty, keeping promises, compassion, integrity, confidence and adaptability.\nHowever, she said, the reality is that women are questioned on a lot of things men are not: When they have children, what they wear, and so much more.\u00a0\n\u201cWomen still face different questions in the interview room. They are still asked about their potential procreative side. I know women who take off their wedding rings to ensure they are not treated as potential mums,\u201d she said prompting a comment from a woman in the room who said she was once asked: \u201cBut now that you are responsible for another human being, how do you expect to cope with this role?\u201d\u00a0\nRepresentatives of the community\u00a0\nThe figures, she added, show there are more women in local councils (22 per cent) than serving as MPs (13.1 per cent) and ministers (10.1 per cent). These women are living in the grass roots and have a lot to offer.\n\u201cWe need the input of women because they have another stand on health, economy and many issues. They are often part of the grass roots and the community \u2013 these are the people we want in Parliament. Politicians need to be representatives of the different groups in society,\u201d she stressed.\nAlso speaking at the event, journalist Josanne Cassar said she was concerned that quotas on women would not work without \u201ca huge support structure\u201d. The reality is that women still take on the bulk of the child caring role and, juggling this with their job and a political career may not seem worth it without the right support.\n\u201cThe government talks about having more women, but what is stopping it from putting more women on boards?\u201d she said.\u00a0\nSilvan Agius, director of Human Rights and Integration Directorate within the Ministry for European Affairs and Equality, said the government was working on a strategy and the next step would be to transpose it into every government ministry and directorate.\u00a0\n\u201cThe only way forward is adopting a systematic approach and having the same rules apply across the government.

It was then announced in February that the painting would go under the hammer on June 27.\nProf. Sciberras believes that whoever painted this work could have possibly seen Caravaggio at work or had access to his works.\nSome connoisseurs have, in fact, suggested that the painting could have been a copy of one of his Franco-Flemish disciples, Louis Finson.\nFinson was a recognised artist in his own right, who both owned and reproduced Caravaggio\u2019s work. He was also an art dealer who may have had an ulterior motive in making Caravaggio duplicates and then selling them off to wealthy merchants in his native Bruges and Amsterdam.\u00a0\nHe is known to have had at least one reproduction of the missing tableau, which now hangs at the Palazzo Zevallos in Naples.\nProf. Sciberras is, however, not entirely convinced about this claim either.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know who the artist was\u2026 but, you know, people want names,\u201d he said.\u00a0\n\u201cSome also suggested that it could have been done by two hands, meaning that is was started by Caravaggio and continued by someone else, but I find that improbable,\u201d he remarked.\nThe painting was sold in Toulouse by Marc Labarbe, the provincial auctioneer who discovered the work after a local family asked him to value some \u201cold things in the attic\u201d of a house they were clearing.

I phoned my pimp, but he wouldn\u2019t take me to hospital.\u201d\nShe likened these conditions to those of chained dogs, which had been given protection by the government, and questioned how this state of affairs could persist in Malta.\nMs Buttigieg intervened during a debate on amendments to the law on domestic and gender-based violence which resulted from the Istanbul Convention last year. The amendments are being moved by Equality Minister Helena Dalli.\nThe amendments would increase the fines which could be levied on perpetrators and prohibit the filming of sexual acts without the consent of the person being filmed, among other changes. They would also allow for the gradual payment of damages, in order to allow the victim to receive compensation without financially crippling the perpetrator.\nMs Buttigieg made reference to Germany where brothels were \u201cas large as supermarkets\u201d and clients had a \u201cmenu\u201d of services to choose from. Germany had 400,000 legal sex workers who serviced over a million clients every day, and many of these sex workers were treated \u201cno better than animals\u201d.\nThe vast majority of women in prostitution were groomed from as tender an age as 12 or 13, and many started engaging in sex work before they were 18. Most prostitutes came from dysfunctional families, and were targeted by pimps and groomed by family members, boyfriends, or pseudo work agents.\nThe Opposition would be voting in favour of the amendments, she said, but lamented that domestic and gender-based violence laws were failing to be put into practice due to reasons which had to do with the composition of Maltese society.\nThe media was failing to draw sufficient attention to the fact that domestic violence was not just \u201cwomen\u2019s problem\u201d but a social problem which was undermining Maltese society.\nMs Buttigieg referred to a recent interview with lawyer and activist Lara Dimitrijevic, which had shown that reports of domestic violence had increased, and that women continued to be the most affected. Victims were told not to file reports because these would ultimately backfire on them, Dr Dimitrijevic had said, as she recounted one particular case where a victim was scolded by the police for \u201cexaggerating\u201d.\nThis showed that, in spite of a law passed in 2018, the police were not sufficiently prepared to deal with issues of domestic violence.\nIt did not help that it took so long to bring perpetrators to justice, intensifying the victimisation of those who were already suffering.\nOther Opposition MPs discussed various aspects of the amendments. Opposition MP Kevin Cutajar addressed the phenomenon of revenge pornography, arguing that it could not be addressed simply through legislation but that there was a need to provide training and appropriate technology to police working to combat such crimes.\nDr Cutajar and Opposition MP Therese Comodini Cachia both questioned the decision to separate the stages of assessment and investigation in response to allegations of domestic or gender-based violence.\u00a0\nDr Cutajar and Dr Comodini Cachia both questioned whether adding a person with disability to the Gender-Based Violence and Domestic Violence Commission would have practical results, or whether this representative would simply be a token figure. The requirement that those suffering from disability be represented on the Commission should be accompanied with the proper support for the representative in question.\nOpposition MP Edwin Vassallo objected to an amendment which defined gender as \u201cthe socially constructed roles, expectations, activities, behaviours and attributes that society at any given time associates with a person of any sex, assuming any form of gender identity or gender expression.\" This represented a departure from a natural understanding of gender, he said, allowing the state to determine and define the meaning of gender.\nThe government should respect the natural difference between the sexes, he said.

Vanessa Macdonald explains the main points of this law.\nWhat laws cover the sector?\nThe Periti Act of 1999 outlines the qualifications of architects and their warranting but does not go into their responsibilities. That falls partly under the Civil Code, Article 1638, which lays the responsibility for a building of not only the architect but also the contractor. The responsibility is valid for 15 years from completion and covers any defect in construction. How the responsibility would be shared between the architect and the contractor was basically left up to the courts to decide \u2013 and will now be even harder to determine\nThe Development Planning Act says that applications can only be submitted by an architect, while the Building Regulation Act (2011) gives them the duty to sign off on completion of projects as being compliant with regulations.\u00a0\nThe Building Regulation Act provides for the registration and authorisation of those working for the sector or supplying materials for it. The Building Regulation Office (BRO) was given this task and could also suspend, withdraw or delete any licence or registration it has issued.\u00a0\nWide-ranging categories of workers required licensing with a register meant to be held by the BRO and to be available to the public \u2013 but this was until now not done in full. Former Chamber of Architects and Civil Engineers (KTP) president Alex Torpiano complained that the information registered was incomplete \u2013 for example, without a validity period or ID card number for identification.\nHowever, the laws referred to above did not delve into the role of the site manager beyond explaining how they would be involved in the case of notifications.\nSo from where does the concept of a site manager emerge?\u00a0\nThe site manager was originally the person who would protect the owner\u2019s interest, there to ensure that the contractor was doing what they were supposed to do.\nUntil now, the role was defined by the Environmental Management Construction Site Regulations, 2007, which says that the site manager could be (a) the owner himself; (b) the project supervisor as construed in the Minimum Health and Safety Requirements for work and construction sites regulations of 2004; (c) an architect; or (d) any other competent person.\u00a0\nIn the absence of a nominated site manager, the owner would by default be given that role. The law saw the role of the site manager as complementing that of the architect, making them responsible for ensuring that permits, certifications, authorisations or approvals were in place.\nThe new law would make architects the site technical officers\nWhere do third party rights come into the picture?\nThese are encapsulated in the Avoidance of Damage to Third Party Property Regulations of 2013, which make the site manager the sole person responsible for compliance with this set of regulations and which make the developer the default site manager if no one is formally appointed.\nThe KTP has been asking for years for the complex web of different laws to be reviewed as it was too cumbersome to work with. However, the new regulations seem to create even more anomalies by changing clauses in one Act without clarifying their impact on other laws.\nMoreover, instead of being nominated by the owner to look after their interests, the site technical officer will be nominated by the very contractor that they are meant to be monitoring.\u00a0\nIf the law already envisaged that architects could be site managers, what is all the fuss about?\nThe new law would make architects the \u201csite technical officers\u201d, which poses logistical problems. Does an architect have time to go to each site to ensure that the contractor does what they were told to do?\nPerhaps the best analogy would be that of a nurse and a doctor. A doctor would decide on the medication to give a patient and would instruct the nurse, assuming that they had enough knowledge and experience, to carry out those instructions. The new law is a bit like saying that doctors actually have to be there whenever the nurse does so, which is clearly not feasible.\u00a0\nIt is also not clear what happens to the current appointed site managers and whether they are all out of a job as of today.\nIs the role of the STO the only issue?\nAlas, no.

Sounding a warning for the future, the experts say that the fire could have spread much deeper into the woodland had a few dirt roads and paths not acted as barriers to contain the rising flames.\nWhich species burnt down?\nThe report does not quantify how many trees were lost, saying only that a \u201clarge number\u201d were burnt down.\nThese were mostly Aleppo Pine, invasive Olive Trees, Gum Trees, and Blue-leaved wattle, - an invasive species known locally as l-Aka\u010bja.\nAside from burnt trees, some over-turned ones were also found during an onsite inspection.\nThese trees, the experts report, probably lay horizontally as they had been planted on shallow garigue, and may have assisted in the rapid spread of the flames.\nWhy did the fire spread?\nThese however, were not the leading cause of the extent of the blaze.\nAccording to the report, it was the presence of \u201chighly flammable species\u201d, such as pines and eucalyptus, the large extent of combustible pine needle cover on the ground, and significant amounts of human litter dumped throughout the wooded area which are considered to be the main factors in assisting the spread of the blaze.\n\u201cThe combination of trees, besides not being natural, includes some of the most flammable species in the world,\u201d the report reads.\nIt later adds that the planting of highly flammable alien species, not only \u201cconsiderably reduced biodiversity\u201d, but also posed a major fire hazard.\nThe document does not get into what caused the fire to spread, which is currently the subject of a police investigation.\nMeanwhile, sources involved in policing the island\u2019s green outdoor spaces have told Times of Malta that the likeliest cause was the burning of pruned branches in nearby fields.\nThe blaze left a large number of scorched trees.

Traffic, meanwhile, is expected to increase by around 21 per cent over current levels, with an average of 2,569 additional car trips along Qui-si-Sana on weekdays, down from 3,500 with the earlier plans.

Objections at the time had highlighted the excessive visual impact, traffic and congestion problems in Qui-Si-Sana and the negative impact on nearby residents\u2019 quality of life.The appeal decision, which annulled the permit and sent the developers back to the drawing board, had primarily cited the inadequacy of impact studies carried out for the project, all of which have since been conducted anew.", "comment_count": 19, "id": 1718}]
