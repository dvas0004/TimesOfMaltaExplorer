In a decree by Magistrate Doreen Clarke, the court said the documents presented by Dr Busuttil and NGO Repubblika gave credence to the request for an inquiry to preserve evidence. The magistrate said a series of facts were presented that could indicate a crime took place. This decree came over three years since the Panama Papers scandal first broke in Malta. The court said the list of potential crimes presented to it were not fully covered by another inquiry being led by Magistrate Charmaine Galea. For this purpose, the court ordered that the evidence presented to it form part of the inquiry being led by Dr Galea. The inquiry by Dr Galea is looking into the ownership of the Dubai company17 Black. Evidence implicating Tourism Minister Konrad Mizzi, the Prime Minister\u2019s chief of staff Keith Schembri, Nexia BT\u2019s Brian Tonna and Karl Cini as well as LNG tanker agent Mario Pullicino, will now form part of this inquiry. A joint investigation by the Times of Malta and Reuters last year revealed that 17 Black is owned by Tumas Group CEO Yorgen Fenech, who forms part of the Electrogas power station consortium. A previous request for a broad inquiry into the Panama Papers filed in 2017 was turned down on appeal in January. In a tweet, Dr Busuttil said the decision was \u201cone small step for justice but one giant leap for Malta\u201d.\nAG to handle prosecutions in Magistrates\u2019 Court, not police: Prosecutions in the Magistrates\u2019 Court will no longer be led by the police but by the Attorney General\u2019s Office, Justice Minister Owen Bonnici told a press conference. This radical change is part of a Bill that seeks to address a series of shortcomings in Malta\u2019s judicial setup, which were flagged last year by a group of Council of Europe experts known as the Venice Commission. Dr Bonnici said the reform would lead to the setting up of the Office of State Advocate, who would take over the Attorney General\u2019s function as the government\u2019s chief legal adviser.\nFuel used in Floriana arch arson: Investigators concluded that fuel was used to burn down Floriana\u2019s historic arch last week, in a case that was \u2018definitely arson\u2019, sources said.

It is an important part of our diet and culture. Fresh and frozen fish is sold in markets, fish shops and supermarkets. But how sustainable are our practices?\n\nFish quotas regulate fishing of certain species of fish. These catch limits are expressed in tons or numbers. When the catch limits for a fish are reached, the season closes, prohibiting further fishing for that type of fish.\nThe NGO Fish4tomorrow was formed in 2010. It aims to raise local awareness on the importance of seafood from sustainable sources. When interviewed about sustainability of local fishing practices, Fish4tomorrow spokesman J D Farrugia said that whereas in previous years there used to be an abundance of fish, nowadays the Maltese waters are void. Fish such as grouper, white sea bream, red snapper, red scorpionfish, dentex and the common pandora have practically vanished from the fish market. If one finds them, they sell at high prices and may be imported.\nFarrugia explained that small-scale artisanal fishers using lines with hooks (konzijiet) have little impact on the fish populations they catch and the surrounding environment. However, large fishing operations such as bottom trawling have negative effects on fish stocks, the environment and also other species that they are not targeting, such as sharks, dolphins and turtles. They catch fish in such high quantities that practically no fish are left to breed in the area, thus the shoal cannot regenerate.\nTuna is being ranched locally. Young tuna individuals entering the Mediterranean Sea are caught before they spawn, taken to tuna pens, fattened, grown and exported. The tuna do not reproduce in captivity, thus it is killed before it reproduces.\nMoreover tons of mackerel are used to feed tuna (25 kilograms of mackerel is needed to produce one kilogram of tuna). All these factors make tuna unsustainable.\nAnother detrimental factor is the large amounts of traps and nets abandoned at sea. Fish get trapped and they attract predators, which in turn get caught. This is referred to as ghost fishing.\nWhen asked about the level of awareness of Maltese fishermen, Farrugia said that many traditional fishers were aware of the importance of fishing in ways which do not harm the environment. The government ran a campaign on sustainable fishing a few years ago. But in another interview, a full-time and a part-time fisherman both said that while they were advised on issues such as health and safety and diversification, they were not trained in sustainable fishing techniques. They claimed that the officials themselves did not know the way forward and there is not a team of officials and that officials change frequently.\nWhereas in previous years there used to be an abundance of fish, nowadays the Maltese waters are void\nThe full-time fisherman said the trade is no longer viable and if the government were to introduce the decommissioning scheme, most fishermen would go for it. He explained that if a fish is not easily available, he cannot diversify because there are restrictions.\nAs regards consumers, Farrugia said that there is a need for more awareness. The NGO has created tools such as the Quickfish Guide to help consumers make responsible choices that ensure the viability of local fish stocks for future generations. Fish4tomorrow also organises awareness-raising events such as pop-up dinners called From Our Sea. Here, people book places to the event and a chef prepares a tasty menu of local, seasonal and sustainable seafood. In this way, consumers can see that sustainable seafood such as bogue (vopi) or Atlantic mackerel (kavall) are actually very tasty as well as caught in an environmentally-responsible manner.\nA frozen fish product with the MSC label.\nThe Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) is an international non-profit organisation. Its goal is to end overfishing and to ensure that this and future generations can continue to enjoy wild seafood. It urges people to choose certified sustainable seafood with the blue fish label. The ecolabel is only applied to wild fish or seafood from fisheries that have been certified by the MSC as sustainable. Sustainable fishing means leaving enough fish in the ocean, respecting habitats and ensuring people who depend on fishing can maintain their livelihoods.\nA survey was carried out to assess the level of awareness of Maltese consumers about the MSC label. Data was collected from 30 consumers. The results were as follows:\n\u2022\u200287 per cent of the consumers interviewed recognised that the label was related to fish.\n\u2022\u2002Only 13 per cent of the consumers knew that this label is related to sustainable fishing.\n\u2022\u200230 per cent of the consumers had an idea of what sustainable fishing is. They described it as \u201ccontrolled fishing\u201d, \u201creleasing small fish\u201d, \u201cnot exceeding the quotas\u201d, and \u201ccatching fish in the right season\u201d.\n\u2022\u200255 per cent had heard the phrase, but did not know what it meant.\n\u2022\u200215 per cent had never heard about sustainable fishing.\nVisits to popular fisheries and a fish market showed that none of the locally caught fish displayed the MSC label. A survey of products in a major supermarket in the Sliema/St Julian\u2019s area showed that 90 per cent of the imported frozen fish had the MSC label. On the other hand, only 25 per cent of the imported frozen fish in a small grocery store had the MSC label. In all cases, none of the locally packed fish had the MSC label.\nRecommendations\nIt is important to stop the exploitation of popular fish, such as steak fish. Currently a lot of fish is not eaten because there is not enough promotion for this kind of fish even though it is very cheap, highly sustainable and quite good. Horse Mackerel (sawrell), Frigate Mackerel (tumbrell), Pompano (strilja) and Atlantic Bonito (plamtu) are available, tasty and easy to prepare.\nIt is important to keep fish consumption high while giving the consumer a wider and more sustainable choice. Consumers can be educated through various means such as TV programmes, activities through local councils or those held in fishing villages. Leaflets and posters promoting consumption of sustainable fish can be displayed in fish shops.\nIt is important to save fish stocks, the ecosystems and at the same time safeguard the livelihood of people who depend on fishing. Moreover local traditions and culture related to fishing must be preserved.\nGabriel Pullicino, 12, is a Year 8 student at St Augustine College.

This new 1.5-kilometre underground link will include two lanes, one in each direction. It will completely bypass the residential areas of Pembroke and Swieqi, while providing quicker connections to the Paceville and St Julian\u2019s seafront areas from the northern parts of Malta.\nUnlike previous proposals, the new infrastructure will improve public access to several areas in and around Paceville and St Julian\u2019s, and not to specific developments only, IM said.\nA 500-metre one-lane tunnel will link the northbound carriageway of Regional Road, before reaching the Paceville traffic lights junction, to Pembroke (Walter Ganado Street), for easier access to this locality from the southern part of Malta.\nThe third tunnel will connect the same carriageway of Regional Road to St George\u2019s Bay, to provide a safer and quicker alternative to the existing Paceville traffic lights junction.\nA fourth, 115-metre underground connection will start at Church Street (Millenium Chapel area) and exit at Spinola Bay (St George\u2019s Road), creating a new exit from Paceville while reducing congestion difficulties in several nearby adjoining roads and junctions.\nAnother new connection between Olive Street, in The Gardens area of St Julian\u2019s, and Regional Road\u2019s southbound carriageway, just before the Manwel Dimech Bridge, will also be developed.
