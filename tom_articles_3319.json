The nature of the due diligence checks is also public.\u201d\nFact: The government publishes a general list of all people who became naturalised citizens over a one-year period, not a specific list of people who bought Maltese and EU citizenship under the cash-for-passports scheme.\nThe scheme\u2019s regulator has endorsed a call by local lobbyists to remove the names of passport buyers from this annual list. The regulator instead suggested that MPs should be given access to the data under an oath of secrecy.\nPanama Papers\nClaim: \u201cIn Malta we have a functioning rule of law. We have judges, we have police, we have investigations. The two major inquiries stated there were no legal grounds upon which to proceed against the people who are allegedly corrupt.\u201d\nFact: Dr Bonnici uses two inquiries instigated by politicians as a blanket clearance of any wrongdoing in the Panama Papers case.\nHe gave the committee the impression that inquiries were started during the normal course of investigations. In fact, cases only began because former Opposition leader Simon Busuttil took to the courts due to the lack of police action.\nDr Busuttil presented leaked FIAU reports which the police had declined to act upon to the courts.\nRead: What the Justice Minister told the EP's financial crimes committee\nThe Justice Minister did not tell the Committee that the police failed to act on an April 2016 request by the FIAU to begin an immediate investigation into the Prime Minister\u2019s chief of staff Keith Schembri and Tourism Minister Konrad Mizzi.\nExtent of his powers\nClaim: \u201cIt would be dangerous if the Justice Minister knew the details of an investigation. I hope investigations come to a close expeditiously.\u201d\nFact: The Justice Minister was given full access to the 1,400 page Egrant inquiry, providing legal counsel to the Prime Minister.\nOnly selected conclusions from the inquiry were published. It recommended further investigations into a number of people, and key characters like Nexia BT\u2019s Karl Cini, ex-FIAU manager Jonathan Ferris and Adrian Delia aide Pierre Portelli have been called in for questioning.\nThe government has refused to publish an unredacted copy of the Egrant report, citing privacy concerns.\n\nVenice Commission\nClaim: \u201cWork is also under way on Constitutional reform particularly, but not only, in the light of the Venice Commission Opinion of last December, which we asked for and we welcomed.\u201d\nFact: Dr Bonnici gave the impression that the Venice Commission report was solicited by the government, when it was the Council of Europe which first requested an opinion on Malta.\nThe very preamble to the Venice Commission\u2019s December report clearly shows that the CoE made the initial request, on October 10.\nThat same preamble shows that the government request for an opinion came three days after the Council of Europe\u2019s.\n\n'I gave no wrong information' - minister\nIn reaction, the minister said the article above \"misses the point\" on every matter raised.\n\"I gave no wrong information to the TAX 3 Committee despite your efforts to disseminate misinformation to the contrary.\"\nThis is his reaction in full:\nCitizenship: Why does the fact that the names of persons acquiring Maltese citizenship through the IIP programme are not published in isolation but in a list of all persons who acquired Maltese citizenship during the year make a difference as to whether such names are published or not? Such persons become Maltese citizens like all the rest. The fact remains that Malta publishes the names as distinct from what goes on in other countries.\nPanama Papers: It was obviously not to the liking of some politicians that the courts have found that the information submitted to them by former Opposition Leader Simon Busuttil in support of his claim to start a magisterial inquiry did not meet the requirements of the law. That is nevertheless a fact resulting from two court decisions which are well known to all in Malta and obviously also to the MEP\u2019s on the TAX 3 Committee.

Again, MEPs are not gullible.\nExtent of the powers of the Justice Minister: Unlike the situation in a substantial number of other European countries, the Ministry of Justice in Malta has no residual or exceptional powers with regard to prosecutions. This is all the more so with regard to investigations. Access to the Egrant inquiry report for the purpose of advising the Prime Minister as Minister of Justice was only given after that report was concluded, its main conclusions were made public and a copy had been released to the Prime Minister.

There is no such right of access as I correctly informed the TAX 3 Committee accordingly.\nVenice Commission: Irrespective of the three-day gap between the request of a Committee of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe to the Venice Commission and that of the Government of Malta, the fact remains that the Government itself invited the Venice Commission to express its opinion on Malta.\nThis happened following a meeting with an EP committee, where this suggestion was mooted from the side of MEP Sophie in \u2018t Veld.

At the time, they had hinted that a senior official at Malta\u2019s fisheries department could have been facilitating the process.Suspicions had first been roused after a tuna company\u2019s request to increase its export quota by 33 per cent had been waved through by the department without the necessary checks.

The occupants, described as a middle-aged male driver and teenage passenger, were also the same throughout.\nWhat the authors found was that out of 185 interactions they analysed, just 43 drivers \u2013 less than a quarter \u2013 allowed what they call \u201ccourteous access\u201d.\nLuxury car, truck and van drivers were the least likely to afford courteous access\nDrivers\u2019 gender, weather conditions and the presence or absence of other adults or children in the car all seemed to have little bearing, with statistically similar results in all cases.\nBut vehicle type pointed to some significant differences: drivers of medium-sized saloons tended to be more likely to let the testers pass than those in small-sized cars, luxury vehicles, trucks or vans.\nOf the 48 saloons in the study, 18 drivers \u2013 37.5 per cent \u2013 allowed access and 30 did not. By comparison, small cars gave way just 22 per cent of the time, and luxury or work vehicles just 11 per cent.\nCombining vehicle type with the drivers\u2019 gender and age revealed even starker differences.

These are then stacked and placed on shelves in a cupboard for drying.\nThis process may take from one day to a week, after which the sheets are placed in a cutting machine and punched into individual disks of 3.1cm diameter each \u2013 the finished communion wafers. These machines can cut up to 42 hosts at a time; others punch larger, single hosts measuring 7.5cm each that are used by priests when celebrating Mass.\nBefore packing and consigning, the hosts are checked for flaws and \u2018dents\u2019.

Institutions such as St Vincent de Paule Residence order 4kgs a month.\nAnd the cost? Each convent has its own pricing structure that varies from \u20ac23.29 to \u20ac27.95 a kilo.\nThis age-old industry, a cottage one at best, is now facing competition. Firstly, neither convent has a daily production line; the Missionary Sisters bake hosts on two days a week and employ two lay helpers. In Msida, two Franciscan nuns produce their communion bread three days a week, sometimes four.\nForeign competition\nDwindling church attendance is one contributing factor to the drop in demand for convent-produced hosts.\nThe other is that many parishes are now buying foreign-made hosts. And the major importer is the religious shop Emmaus, run by the Conventual Franciscans\u00a0at their Centru Animazzjoni u Komunikazzjoni in Birkirkara.\nAlthough they import from various sources, the Italian manufacturer Ostificio Domus appears to be Emmaus\u2019s principal supplier.\nAvailable from the Birkirkara outlet are packs of 500 hosts, measuring 3.5cm each at \u20ac2.40 \u2013 that\u2019s \u20ac19.20 for a kilo, considerably cheaper than convent produced communion bread. Tins of 3,000 are price-tagged at \u20ac19.\nEmmaus also sell gluten-free hosts \u2013 something the nuns do not produce \u2013 and say the demand is growing. Packs of 25, 3.5cm hosts retail at \u20ac2.40 and are also available in containers of 50 at \u20ac4.50.\nIt is not only the Roman Catholic church that buys sacramental bread, many other Christian denominations also partake of communion and acquire their hosts locally. Because their communities are so much smaller, quantities are miniscule in comparison. For example, St Paul\u2019s Pro-Cathedral in Valletta use about 200 hosts a week, bought from a religious goods shop in the capital.\nAlthough other denominations help keep the \u2018hosts business\u2019 alive, we are unlikely to see a reversal of fortunes for the convents that produce the communion bread.", "comment_count": 13, "id": 1192}, {"keywords": "", "author": "Ivan Martin", "article_body": "The proposal for an underground train system for the island has captured the public imagination. Ivan Martin speaks with the architect behind the idea of a Malta Metro.\nImagine entering a metro station beneath Valletta\u2019s Triton Square and coming out at the airport in 15 minutes or the bus station in central Victoria Gozo in just half an hour.\nAn opinion piece in last week\u2019s The Sunday Times of Malta mapping out such a Malta Metro system went viral.\u00a0\nKonrad Xuereb, a director at KonceptX, an architectural and structural engineering firm with offices in Malta and London, believes that his proposal is not only feasible, but could solve many of the island\u2019s traffic related problems.\nHe is proposing a national metro system to be carried out in three phases. Based on the use of two tunnel boring machines, the first phase of the proposed metro could take just five years to be completed. The second and third phases would be anticipated to take a further two and three years respectively.\nThe first phase could be approximately 25km long, connecting Mellie\u0127a to Bir\u017cebbu\u0121a, with a loop at the end to the airport.\nThis metro line, he says, could stop in dense urban centres including St Paul\u2019s Bay, Pembroke and Paceville, St Julian\u2019s, Sliema, and Msida with stops at the University of Malta and Mater Dei Hospital). Valletta, Paola and \u017bejtun could also have stops.\nThe second phase would be approximately 10km long, connecting the airport to St Paul\u2019s Bay in the north, allowing the metro to form a loop.\nThis second part of the metro could link other dense urban centres including Qormi, Birkirkara, possibly Mrie\u0127el and Mosta.\nThe third and final stage would be approximately 15km long, extending between Mellie\u0127a and Gozo, connecting Xewkija, Rabat and Marsalforn on the sister isle Gozo.\nIt would take merely half an hour, Dr Xuereb said, for someone to board the metro at Victoria in Gozo and arrive at the University, Valletta or the airport.\nIs this a realistic timeline? Dr Xuereb said that, to put things into perspective, construction work on the 118km long Crossrail underground metro in London (more than double the length of that proposed for Malta) started in mid-2009 and is planned to open later this year.\u00a0\nWhat to do with the rubble?\nAnd what about the debris that digging a Malta metro would generate? Dr Xuereb anticipates that the excavation for the whole metro system, including the 20 metro stations proposed for across Malta and Gozo, could generate between three to four million cubic metres of earth in waste.\nIn the Crossrail underground line in London over three million tons of earth from tunnel excavation were used to create a new nature conservation area at Wallasea Island on the River Thames Estuary, transforming it into a thriving wetland teeming with bird and marine life.\nSubject to detailed environmental studies, most of the inert waste from the construction of the proposed Malta metro could be strategically used for land reclamation to form an offshore nature reserve or an offshore wind farm, Dr Xuereb said.\nTravelling by metro from Valletta to the airport would take 15 minutes\nAn offshore windfarm could also be complemented by an offshore solar farm, with the solar panels connected to the national grid.\nThe London Array offshore wind farm, for example, is a 175 turbine 630\u00a0MW windfarm in the Thames estuary meeting the electricity needs of 750,000 homes and cutting annual carbon emissions by 900,000 tonnes, equivalent to that generated by 300,000 passenger cars.\nWould tunnels destroy archaeological remains?\nAnd as for the impact digging a tunnel could have on the island\u2019s geology, Dr Xuereb said the Malta metro tunnel would predominantly be located at a depth of approximately 25 metres below ground level, dipping gently under the channel.\nThis would ensure that the construction of the tunnel would not disturb the superficial soils and top geological strata where any yet undiscovered archaeological remains may be lying. Notwithstanding this, detailed environmental and archaeological studies would be required before the final metro route and station locations could be fixed.\nThe location of most large cities close to waterways like rivers entails that new metro projects typically encounter complex ground conditions during construction of the tunnels.\nIllustrating this further, Dr Xuereb said the construction of the Crossrail underground line in London entailed boring through varying, challenging, ground conditions including London Clay and Thanet Sands, which necessitated assessment of ground movements and mitigation strategies like ground stabilisation to limit damage to the buildings lying along the metro alignment.\n\u201cBy comparison, the anticipated geology of Malta along most of the proposed metro route is likely to make tunnelling for an underground metro less challenging, with a smaller risk of damage to overlying buildings during tunnelling,\u201d he said.\nHow much could it cost?\nWhat about the cost? Well, Dr Xuereb said that for a metro to be feasible in Malta it would need to capture the largest number of people with the shortest length possible.\n\u201cI would calculate that the capital expenditure to build a national underground system would easily reach \u20ac3 billion to \u20ac4 billion, which is nearly four times the anticipated cost of a vehicular tunnel between Malta and Gozo,\u201d he said.\u00a0\nHowever, the revenue generated from a national metro system would be much higher than a vehicular tunnel given the much larger population it would attract, including the millions of tourists visiting the islands every year.\nAdvertising on the trains and in the metro stations could also bring in revenue and the government could obtain further cash from leasing spaces within the metro stations for retail outlets.\nThe Crossrail project in London is nearly two-and-a-half times the length of the proposed Malta metro, tunnelled through more complex ground conditions and requiring more than double the number of metro stations that would be needed in Malta. Crossrail is anticipated to cost nearly \u20ac17 billion, but annual ticket revenues are forecasted to exceed \u20ac900 million annually in 2020 to 2021 and over\u20ac1 billion annually after that.\nA national metro system would also drastically reduce the number of cars on the road \u2013 cutting down on pollution from vehicles, with significant cost savings in healthcare and increased quality of life.\n\u201cThere is a strong need for Malta to address the public transport system holistically with a permanent connection to Gozo forming part of such a system.

It is difficult to cater for personal needs in a big church where the right motivated would want mainly to reconnect with themselves and go back home with some more inner peace and harmony.\n\u201cThat explains why parallel with what is happening in our parishes, there are so many other sacred spaces where people feel they belong. It is because there is a sense of belonging that \u2018ritual\u2019 makes more sense. So the issue is belonging, perhaps a remedy for stress, solitude, and other charateristics of the age.\u201d\nAnd little can be done to make religion more meaningful to the ordinary person if the starting point is the Sunday congregation, says Fr Camilleri, a weekly contributor to this newspaper\u2019s Christian Spirituality page.\n\u201cThe main issue with religion is not Mass attendance on Sunday. That can only make sense in a context.

Citizen science thus gives scientists the ability to expand research taxonomically, geographically and temporally.\nAlthough citizen science currently has a supportive role in conservation and ecology, an increasing number of researchers are recognising its benefits and are working with citizen scientists.\nThis is just as true in Malta as it is elsewhere in the world. More and more people in Malta are becoming citizen scientists, and the benefits are huge both for them as individuals and for science on the islands.\nCitizen science [is] a vital step towards democratising science\nIn Malta, Green House volunteers monitor and record data on orchids and bees while out on nature walks. They also monitor and record bat sightings by going on night walks in towns and villages or simply from the comfort of their own backyard by using specially provided bat detectors. Data from these citizen science projects are actively contributing to local biodiversity databases and distribution maps.\nBut the contribution of citizen science goes beyond just gathering or unravelling data. Enthusiastic volunteers also bring their own computer equipment and technological skills to assist with number crunching and data analysis. They fill in knowledge gaps by providing scientists with extra hands, eyes, computers, cameras, smartphones and vehicles.\n\nHowever, like any scientific tool, there are limits to what citizen science can accomplish. Citizen science can get complicated when there are large groups of people involved and it requires a considerable amount of management from organisation to skills training. Not surprisingly, criticism of this kind of collaborative scientific research normally revolves around the accuracy or quality of data collected by people who are not experts in a scientific field.\nInclusivity is also a particular challenge when it comes to citizen science projects. It can be difficult to involve people who don\u2019t have their own transport or access to smartphones, computers and internet.\nYet despite its challenges and limitations, citizen science plays an important role in global conservation initiatives. It can inspire people to take an interest in science and enthuse young people about careers in science. It is also a practical, hands-on way of engaging the public in science which directly affects their physical environment, bridging the gap between society and the scientific community.\nBy giving the wider society the opportunity to be part of the scientific process, citizen science serves as an educational tool for people to become more scientifically literate. This creates more knowledgeable and constructive dialogue between experts and non-experts; which is what makes citizen science, above all, a vital step towards democratising science.\nAnyone can start contributing to the conservation of Malta\u2019s flora and fauna by joining any of the research projects being conducted by Green House.

From bottles to straws to plastic bags, the world produces and consumes roughly one trillion tons of plastic each year, only half of which is disposable.\nThat\u2019s nearly two million pieces of plastic thrown away every minute. This plastic usually finds its way into a landfill, where it will be buried for years or get thrown or blown into the sea where it has a deadly effect on marine life.\nThings are looking more positive, however, as people everywhere wise up to the urgent need to reduce plastic use. Moreover, scientists recently accidentally discovered bacteria that have naturally evolved to eat plastic. This could lead to teams of scientists creating a mutant enzyme which will break down plastic bottles. A breakthrough like this could help solve the global problem of plastic.\nA team of researchers at the University of Malta has also jumped onto this eco bandwagon and a university-led research programme is looking at possible ways to accelerate the deterioration of plastic sold commercially in Malta, with a special emphasis on plastic bottles, containers and shopping bags.\u00a0\nUniversity lecturer and research scientist Gabrielle Zammit is leading the team of both undergraduate and postgraduate students in concentrating their efforts on single-use plastic packaging that is in use for a very short time, and which subsequently lingers indefinitely in the environment.\nThis research, which is being funded by the Gasan Foundation, aims to find a way of reducing the lifetime of plastic in the environment after it is discarded, by breaking it down completely to leave only harmless molecules as a by-product. The team is currently working with microbes that are naturally occurring and have not been genetically modified.\nApart from the experiments conducted using these aforementioned promising micro-organisms the team is also investigating how single-use plastics break down in soil and sea water, which will give a clearer understanding of the\u00a0 deterioration processes that occur due to naturally occurring microbial communities.\nWhile the research has already yielded some positive results for simple plastic polymers, the challenge remains in breaking down the plastic that is sold commercially due to the additives added during the manufacturing process that make superior quality materials useful as packaging products.\nThe Gasan Foundation is supporting this initiative, which will ensure the completion of the initial phase of the research.", "comment_count": 0, "id": 1210}, {"keywords": "Gozo", "author": "", "article_body": "The oldest surviving windmill in Gozo is being given a much-needed facelift after the Planning Commission approved restoration works on the historic building.\nCommissioned by Grand Master Perellos in the beginning of the 18th century, the windmill at Xewkija is the only one with a tower based on an octagonal base.\nThe windmill\u2019s mechanism is also being reconstructed by the Gozo Ministry workers.\nThe windmill, on the way to Victoria, started operating in 1710 by miller \u0120anni Scicluna.

In 2019, it was estimated that the demand for IT professionals was just under 6.2 million, while there was a supply of just under six million.\nThere has also been a corresponding increase in demand for IT professionalism in the sector. This is not a coincidence especially with the advancement in technology and emerging technologies in artificial intelligence, robotics, Internet-of-Things, big data, high-performance computing, nano-technology and others.\nCybercrime and fraud have also increased at the same pace, perhaps the same technology has presented them with more opportunities. Business and government have responded with the emerging of standards and practices like the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), cybersecurity, ethical hacking, the blockchain, process analysis, and so much more.\nBut is this enough? Arguably the most important and probably the most unnoticeable aspect against all technology malpractices is the ethical behaviour of IT professionals. IT professionals have an important responsibility of exercising their profession in the right and correct manner. During their career they will surely be faced with many challenging situations where they will put ethics into practice.\nEthics are usually defined as a set of principles that govern a person\u2019s behaviour or the conducting of an activity. It is therefore common and very important that professions have a set of principles, usually entitled as a \u2018code of ethics\u2019 that are public and mandatory for members of the profession.\nThe older professions are very well established and are regulated by law. But for the ICT sector, a coherent ethical framework is lacking when compared with medicine, law and engineering, which have codes of ethics and penalties in place for non-compliance.\nEmerging technologies increase the need for compliance to a common set of European code of ethics\nHowever, it must be also recognised that ICT has many associations, with members obliged to uphold a specific code of ethics during their practice. These include professional bodies like the British Computer Society, the Association for Computing Machinery, the Institute of Electrical Engineers, the Computer Society of Malta, the Chamber of Professional Engineers (Malta) and others. But only a proportion of IT professionals and practitioners belong to these bodies, also because they need a high level of qualifications and experience to be members.\nIn 2016, as part of the launch of the European Framework for IT Professionalism, a set of ethical guidelines were released to serve the interests of the public and society, employers, clients, the informatics profession and its practitioners. These are also a value proposition for organisations to develop a code of ethics as guidelines for their ICT practitioners.\nNow is the right time to develop the ICT profession further. The implementation of the emerging technologies mentioned earlier increases the need for compliance to a common set of European code of ethics.\nIt was, therefore, opportune that the European Committee of Standardisation (CEN), through its TC428 technical committee, started work on such a project. Through the eSkills Malta Foundation, on behalf of the Malta Competition and Consumer Affairs Authority, the Maltese standards organisation, Malta is working on these ethics together with other European counterparts in the CEN TC 428. The Foundation looks forward to the further development of the Maltese IT profession and hopes to bring it on par with other European countries.\nCarm Cachia is chief administrator, eSkills Malta Foundation.\nhttps://eskillsalliancecms.gov.mt/en/pages/home.aspx\nhttps://www.facebook.com/eskillsmalta/", "comment_count": 0, "id": 1212}, {"keywords": "Gozo", "author": "", "article_body": "The feast of St John Bosco was celebrated at the Don Bosco Oratory in Victoria last Sunday.
