Another 50 cars at the transport watchdog\u2019s compound are due to be auctioned or else were the subject of legal proceedings.\nTransport Malta\u2019s spokesman pointed out that, since 2017, the regulator had increased the number of enforcement officers to crack down on unauthorised cars on Maltese roads.\nNevertheless, tracing the owner of a foreign-registered car, who may still be of Maltese nationality, remains a long shot for the authorities, including the police.\nThis is proving to be very frustrating, especially for law-abiding citizens, for example when applying for a temporary no-parking permit in front of a residence and a vehicle happens to be parked there.\nOne such case was recently reported in G\u017cira, when a resident vented her anger on Facebook after finding herself unable to carry out works, despite having all the necessary permits in hand for a crane to be used.\nThe obstacle, she claimed, arose because of a foreign-registered car with an expired road licence that was blocking the front of her residence.

It has always been my wish to continue the family tradition but I wanted to do it properly, aided by technology and maintaining modern standards,\u201d one young chicken farmer said.\nEncouraged by what he described as \u201cpromises that the farming sector would be given the attention it so desperately needed by the authorities\u201d, he decided to take up a funding scheme that supports investment in cost-effective and environmentally efficient systems, in order to set up what he believed would be a worthy enterprise.\n\u201cLike most funding schemes, this one does not finance 100 per cent of the capital outlay required, so I \u2013 and many others like me \u2013 had to take out a substantial bank loan that runs into hundreds of thousands. We were all led to believe that the investment would be recouped and that the farming industry was going to be revived, but it turns out that the opposite was true,\u201d he said, visibly worried.\nInstead of seeing the improvements he was promised, he added, these past two years have actually seen a deterioration within the local market. Some periods were so dismal that, for over three months, he was even forced to halt production.\n\u201cThe market always fluctuates. It is to be expected. But not to this extent. At one point my middleman was selling nothing but imported chickens to his customers. He told me bluntly that he couldn\u2019t guarantee any orders. I had to stop breeding for a while,\u201d he explained.\nAsked why he decided to resume business, given that the sector has become so unreliable, his answer was dry and to the point: \u201cBank loans\u201d.\n\u201cAt the moment we do have some orders trickling in. Before shutting down for good, I need to pay off as much as I can from the loan that I took in order to cover the expenses that funding didn\u2019t. It\u2019s a good thing that I am also doing another job, now, or I don\u2019t know how I would be feeding my family. It is very rare that I manage to take money from farming back home,\u201d he said.\nHis colleague, a cow breeder, nodded, his frustration at the situation visible on his face. Perhaps surprisingly, he added that while imports remained a major problem, it is the fact that the playing field is not a level one that is killing the local industry.\n\u201cMaltese farmers and breeders have to work within a very strict framework of EU regulations, which would be fine if these were also applied to everyone else. But they aren\u2019t. So here we are, spending money to make sure we work by the rules while others sail in with imported produce however they please,\u201d he said.\nAsked what he meant by this, the farmer \u2013 another family man in his 30s \u2013 gave me a whole list of grievances where, he claimed, different standards are applied to Maltese and foreign farmers.\nThose who play by the rules are punished while those who bend them get richer\n\u201cIt\u2019s a case of two weights and two measures. We know for a fact that foreign meats are imported to Malta in one container \u2013 pork, beef, chicken and whatever, all chucked together. An importer doesn\u2019t even need to use multiple freezer trucks, so that\u2019s one expense off the list. On the other hand, when Maltese farmers import livestock, we need to ensure there is separate transportation for every species. How is this a level playing field?\u201d he asked.\nThe list continues. He mentions chicken imported from Italy that is repackaged with a \u2018product of Malta\u2019 stamp; produce originating in non-EU countries but imported with an Italian stamp; non-EU produce that is untested for Class 1 pesticides...\n\u201cOf course, they are in a position to sell produce at a much cheaper price. We cannot export our produce, like the bigger countries do, so we have to rely on the local market. But we are not even protecting that. I can tell you that the pork that is being imported from Italy crosses over to Malta stacked up in normal vans. Not in freezer vans,\u201d he said, adding that in the case of Maltese farmers, controls were applied \u201cevery step of the way\u201d.\n\u201cThe model that we follow is fantastic. It comes with the highest standards of equipment and hygiene. At first, I was kind of excited about it. I mean, which farmer doesn\u2019t want to be at the cutting edge of technology? But financially, it just isn\u2019t working out. Our market is too small for us to function within a general EU framework,\u201d he explained.\nHe believes that the Italian market remains the biggest competitor, with farmers there in a position to sell chicken meat at \u20ac1.80 per kilo.\n\u201cWe cannot sell our meat that cheaply. All the raw materials we need are more expensive in Malta, starting with fodder. We even pay more for that in Gozo than they do in Malta, let alone in Italy. If you factor in all the other costs we face \u2013 especially transportation \u2013 the figures speak for themselves. Many who are not involved in the sector accuse us of always bringing forth the same complaints, but since they have not been resolved, what else can we do?\u201d he asked.\nA third farmer, who focuses on fruit and vegetables, expressed dismay at the way the sector is \u201cdeemed unimportant by all administrations, whichever party is in government\u201d.\n\u201cWhat happens when consumption of local produce falls from 30 per cent to zero? Prices will suddenly spike up, that\u2019s what will happen. People don\u2019t realise that the prices of imported foodstuffs are so low only because they need to beat local competition. As soon as there is none of that, suddenly your tomatoes and your chicken breast will become much more expensive. Is anyone planning for this eventuality?\u201d he asked.\nThe likelihood of this happening, he continued, is not remote, given that very few youngsters show an interest in taking up farming.\n\u201cWhy would a 20-year-old pick a job where he\u2019s expected to be on call at all hours, be up at the crack of dawn toiling the fields and generally have no life? Well, not unless there is a sensible structure to count on and the possibility of making a decent living, anyway.\u201d\nThere is one thing that the farmers I speak to are all agreed upon: the system needs to change from the grassroots. Their vision is for a functioning farmers\u2019 association to be set up; a grading station to be established; a direct selling system to be implemented in a regulated manner.\n\u201cAs it is, everything is too scattered. The regulations are there, but they are impractical and applied haphazardly,\u201d yet another one complained, saying that many seemed to believe that thanks to EU funding farmers had \u201cbecome rich overnight\u201d, but that this was not the case.\nA pig farmer nodded and chimed in with: \u201cThe money we got was to help us partially fund new equipment. We all had to fork out a significant amount of capital, added to that, and we have seen no return at all from our investment. I used to kill 22 pigs a week, I now kill five.\u201d\nAsked whether they see a solution, the farmers all give me the same answer \u2013 if the authorities really want to help the local industry, the only solution is to listen to what they really need and to introduce a measure of state aid to the sector.\n\u201cMeantime, those who play by the rules are punished, while those who bend the rules get richer,\u201d the pig-farmer concluded, the bitterness in his voice ringing loud.\nEating local\nThis is the fifth in a series of articles in The Sunday Times of Malta looking at different aspects of the local food industry in a bid to raise more awareness of this crucial, yet often neglected, sector.", "comment_count": 45, "id": 2659}, {"keywords": "", "author": "Philip Leone Ganado", "article_body": "Another year and, it seems, another round of sewage problems at the popular Ras il-\u0126ob\u017c dive spot in Gozo.\nFootage taken by divers last week shows murky discharge flowing freely into the sea from an underwater pipe, the latest in a series of incidents dating back years.\nSimilar problems at the coastal area beside M\u0121arr ix-Xini, and close to a sewage treatment plant, have been reported by divers since at least 2013, with no enduring solution yet found.\nG\u0127ajnsielem deputy mayor Kevin Cauchi, who has repeatedly flagged issues at the site, yesterday called on the authorities to address the \u201cunacceptable situation\u201d and put long-term solutions in place.\n\u201cEven if the outflow has been treated, it is not a pleasant scene in a dive zone, especially when divers come from abroad and spend a lot of money specifically to visit sites like this,\u201d Mr Cauchi told the Times of Malta.\nHe said the authorities had made progress in addressing a related issue at the same site, where clogged manholes were leading to sewage outflow over the land, but had so far failed to tackle the underwater situation.\nThe Water Services Corporation could not be reached for comment yesterday but a spokesman had said the footage was being investigated and that a durable solution was being sought.\nThe corporation also said it was working to improve the technology used to purify the water exiting the pipe.\nThe corporation had last year issued a tender to tackle damage in the undersea outfall, which discharges treated sewage effluent from the Gozo sewage treatment plant into the sea.\nThe end part of the pipeline, which extends 140 metres from the shore and down to a maximum depth of 80 metres, had been completely blocked off over the years.\nThe WSC said the damage had been caused by \u201cimproper use of the urban sewer system\u201d, which was impairing the capacity of both the network and treatment plants.\nSimilar sewage incidents have also been reported numerous times at nearby Xatt l-A\u0127mar, which the authorities also pinned on illegal discharges into the system, blocking or damaging the infrastructure.", "comment_count": 12, "id": 2660}, {"keywords": "", "author": "", "article_body": "Upgrades to the reverse osmosis plants will produce more water using less electricity, Water Management Minister Joe Mizzi told parliament on Tuesday.

A number of Pakistani nurses offered their services through a recruitment agency in their homeland, Deluxe Company Ltd.\nA Maltese company, Chrism Services Ltd, represented by Bonavia and Athwal, was handed a power of attorney to facilitate the transfer of the successful candidates upon completion of the selection process which involved two Skype interviews organized by the Health Ministry.\nThe chosen candidates eventually moved to Malta where they signed a second agreement with the local agency which also offered them accommodation against payment, as well as mobile, internet and television services.\nEach nurse was to fork out \u20ac3,000, paid out of their wages, a further \u20ac120 monthly rental payment and a monthly \u20ac85 management fee from the 13th month till the termination of employment.\nA group of nurses complained with the local authorities that they were being charged hefty sums of money by the persons involved in their recruitment.\nA nurse who felt his contract lacked sufficient formalities spoke to a friend who\u00a0 set up an appointment with the Police Commissioner, thereby sparking off investigations into the suspect racket.\nAnother nurse allegedly told investigators that Mr Athwal had told them that the money was intended to bribe officials at the visa, police and health departments to obtain the necessary work documents.\nHowever, in the course of criminal proceedings against all four suspects, it was proved that the recruitment process had been a legitimate one.\nMeanwhile, the agency contract with Chrism Services Ltd had since been terminated and the nurses were refunded relative payments made.\nIn acquitting the accused of fraud and engaging in a criminal conspiracy, Magistrate Charmaine Galea concluded that it could not \u201cdecipher any formal or material element of fraud,\u201d observing that it had been one nurse who had raised issues about the contract since the contract had not been signed before a notary and under the agency\u2019s letterhead.\nThere was no proof of violence, nor any conduct amounting to harassment, the court said, noting that the nurses had all agreed to the terms of the contract before arriving in Malta.\nAs for the charge of criminal organization, there was \u201cabsolutely no proof\u201d of this, the court declared, adding that the accusation of conspiracy also did \u201cnot hold water.\u201d\nRegarding the charge of unlawful deductions from wages, the court observed that penalties were only applicable to employers.

Sources have told The Sunday Times of Malta that this is due to an increase of foreigners \u2013 residents as well as tourists \u2013 and the growing population of Maltese residents moving to Gozo for its cheaper flat rents.\nOfficial figures show a sevenfold rise in the number of foreigners who used the health centre annually in the past five years, rising to nearly 5,000 last year and contributing to an average of 184 patients seen daily in 2018.\nThis figure was characterised as low by sources. Regular users of the health centre spoke of a growing problem of crowding, particularly in the mornings. In a visit by this newspaper recently, a member of the staff maintained that 150 patients had already visited that day and it was only 11.30am \u2013 the clinic is open from 8am to 8pm.\n\u201cWe\u2019re relatively quiet at the moment,\u201d the staff member said on condition of anonymity. \u201cThe flu season has passed but work will start to pick up soon as the hay fever season gets underway, and then it becomes tough in the summer during the tourist season.

At other times, the single doctor on duty has to serve at the GP clinic and the \u2018treatment room\u2019, where he is intermittently called to examine walk-in patients.\nThe workload has also increased following administrative changes such as requiring GPs themselves to fill in forms of renewals of prescriptions for patients eligible for free medicine.\u00a0\nSources said that there used to be a second doctor in the past, and the flow was speedier. Recent attempts to engage an additional doctor have been unsuccessful.

But one study by the European Commission does shed some light on the practice. The 2015 EU-wide report had looked into the prevalence of white fish being mislabelled on the European market.\nMore than a quarter of the white fish tested in Malta was found to have actually been something else \u2013 the highest in Europe.\u00a0\nConfronted with the findings, industry sources last week were quick to point out that the local leg of the study was based on a limited sample of just 30 products so it could not be considered statistically sound. It was also unclear how much of the fish was local or imported produce.\nThat said, they conceded that the practice of mislabelling fish in Malta \u201ccertainly exists\u201d and encouraged consumers to be diligent.\nThe main risk, they added \u2013 other than getting ripped off \u2013 was the possibility of contracting food poisoning from fish that had not been stored properly.\nIn a room concealed behind a \u2018fake wall\u2019, inspectors discovered boxes stuffed full of tuna \u2013 about 1,200 kilograms of it.\nFish poisoning: 22 cases in 10 years \u00a0\nIn a medical paper on the subject of fish-related food poisoning, consultant physician Martin Balzan reported on a minor outbreak of cases to hit Malta back\u00a0in the early 1990s.\nThe paper tells the tale of a family of five who had contracted what is known as scombroid fish poisoning from a meal of fried lampuki (dolphin fish) in \u017bejtun.\nWithin just 30 minutes of finishing the meal, all members of the family developed strong allergic reactions to the fish, with one even suffering from minor breathing difficulties.\nScombroid fish poisoning, Dr Balzan writes, is caused by the ingestion of fish with a high histamine content, as a result of a bacteria that forms on the fish\u2019s scales when the product is not refrigerated properly.\u00a0\nAsked about the prevalence of fish poisoning cases in Malta, the health authorities said that while cases were \u201csporadic\u201d they did exist.\nFigures supplied by the Health Department show that in the past 10 years, 22 cases of this sort of fish poisoning have been recorded on the island. The bulk, 18 cases, were linked to the consumption of tuna, two were linked to lampuki, one to imported salmon and one more to awrat (sea bream).\nHow fish fraud happens\nThis is not the first time that Maltese authorities have come across questionable fish being served up to consumers in the local market.\nA former inspector who spoke to this newspaper on condition of anonymity explained how every so often the authorities would catch sellers passing off \u201ccopycat fish\u201d to trick buyers. \u00a0\n\u201cWhen we inspected fish shops and even restaurants, what we would sometimes find is certain fish being intentionally mislabelled and passed on to unwitting buyers who can\u2019t tell the difference. This is a practice where \u2018inferior\u2019 fish is presented as another more sought-after species \u2013 obviously with sellers pocketing the substantial difference in price,\u201d he said.\u00a0\nIn some instances, restaurants and fishmongers would sell yellow fin tuna as the far-pricier blue fin species.\n\u201cWhen you see the meat of these two types of fish, they are almost identical. The difference comes in the quality when you cook it and serve it \u2013 and of course the cost price, which is very different,\u201d the former inspector said.\nHe explained how authorities had in the past sent dubious fish overseas for DNA testing to be certain that the species were indeed what the sellers claimed they were.\nOther instances of food fraud included fish mongers passing off shark meat as mazzola (dogfish) and even as swordfish in some cases.\nivan.martin@timesofmalta.com", "comment_count": 26, "id": 2709}, {"keywords": "", "author": "Ivan Camilleri", "article_body": "The government has again been slammed over its \u201clack of commitment\u201d to strengthen the independence of the country\u2019s legal system.\nLegal experts have shot down the latest Bill intended to separate the powers of the Office of the Attorney General as recommended by the Council of Europe\u2019s Venice Commission.\nLiving in the past: King Henry VIII\nKevin Aquilina, a constitutional expert and the Dean of the Faculty of Law at the University of Malta, described the Bill as \u201ca parody of the Venice Commission report\u201d, saying it leaves much to be desired.\n\u201cIt is shabbily drafted and has conceptual flaws.

The family of four visited Rome in May 2018 to see the Coppa Italia final between Juventus and the Prime Minister\u2019s favourite team Milan.\nSeptember saw the family jetting off to Greece and they returned to Italy around the Christmas period.\u00a0\nIn July 2018, the Muscats appeared to combine charity-related work by Mrs Muscat in the US with a trip to Chicago by the Prime Minister and his children.\nA request for information from the Prime Minister about the costs of all these trips and how they were funded was not answered by the time of writing.\nInside Muscatonomics\nDr Muscat\u2019s pay as Prime Minister stood at \u20ac55,978 in 2018 plus \u20ac6,769 in allowances.\nAfter tax and national insurance, that leaves the Prime Minister with around \u20ac44,000 in hand. This figure also factors in a tax rebate for sending his children to a private school. He did not declare any credit card debt.\nAccording to the most recent household budgetary survey, published by the NSO in 2015, an average family with two dependent children spends around \u20ac29,000 annually.\nA private schooling\nThis NSO figure assumes that an average family spends \u20ac1,416 on education. The Muscats\u2019 school fees amount to around \u20ac8,000, not including other expenses like books, uniforms and extra-curricular activities, which will not be factored in for the sake of keeping the estimate conservative.\u00a0\nJust taking the \u20ac8,000 in school fees, less the \u20ac1,416 education expenditure figure already factored into the NSO survey so as not to inflate the overall number, takes the family\u2019s spending up to \u20ac35,584 annually.\nAround the world with \u20ac40k\nThe \u20ac35,584 figure, going on the household budgetary survey estimates, assumes an average Maltese family would spend \u20ac5,000 on leisure activities. These activities are bundled into two broad categories named restaurants and hotels, with an average spend of \u20ac2,324, and recreation and leisure with an average expenditure of \u20ac2,603.\u00a0\nTo avoid double counting, The Sunday Times of Malta is removing the \u20ac2,324 from the \u20ac35,584, although doing so also loses the Muscats\u2019 local spending on restaurants.\nThe Muscat family shared this photo of their trip to Italy in May 2018.\nThis would leave the Prime Minister with \u20ac10,740 as a \u2018holiday fund\u2019 from his net salary before having to resort to his savings.\u00a0\nThe frequency of the Muscats\u2019 trips abroad undoubtedly put them above that of an average family.\nAccording to Eurostat figures released in 2018, Maltese residents spend an average of \u20ac646 per holiday.\nUsing this figure as a baseline would mean the three family holidays in Greece and Italy would put the Muscats\u2019 spending at an estimated \u20ac3,876. This estimate factors in the spending of two adults.\nEstimating the expenses of the Australia and Chicago trips is more difficult, as it is not known to what extent the Muscats paid for flights, accommodation and spending money for each trip.\nFor the sake of calculating a conservative estimate for the flight costs, the assumption is that the Muscats funded the flights for their two children for Australia, and flights for the two children and one adult (the Prime Minister) for the Chicago trip.\nEstimates by The Sunday Times of Malta based on the cheapest economy flights show the Muscats would have spent just under \u20ac4,500 for flights to these two destinations.\nAccommodation and spending money for Australia and Chicago would easily have come in at another \u20ac1,000, bringing the Muscats\u2019 estimated overall holiday spending to \u20ac9,376, or 21.3 per cent of the Prime Minister\u2019s net taxable income.\nA narrow \u2018surplus\u2019?\nGiven that Dr Muscat\u2019s \u2018holiday fund\u2019 stood at \u20ac10,740, this conservative estimated spending would have left him with \u20ac1,364 from his salary.\nThe Muscats also took their children to London for Commonwealth Day in March 2018, although no details were forthcoming about who paid for the children\u2019s travel and accommodation expenses.\nOther expenses in the life of the Muscats vis-\u00e0-vis the average in the household budgetary survey are harder to estimate. The survey puts annual spending on clothing and footwear at \u20ac2,641. Given the Muscats\u2019 penchant for fashion, their spending on such items could conceivably be higher than that of an average family.\nThe Muscats visited Chicago in July 2018, and shared a photo of the trip on social media.\nTransport makes up \u20ac4,500 of the figure in the survey, but the Muscats\u2019 transport costs are likely lower as both parents make use of State cars. The survey attributes costs of \u20ac2,058 to housing, water, electricity gas and other fuels. Again, these costs could be lower as the Muscat family does not have a mortgage to pay.\nHoliday spending questioned in 2017\nIn 2017, the PN had raised questions about whether the Prime Minister had additional sources of income after a leaked receipt showed Dr Muscat paid \u20ac11,000 to stay in an exclusive Dubai hotel in March 2016, when the Panama Papers scandal was still emerging.\u00a0A family trip to Greece.

The choice of schooling of the children is the family\u2019s prerogative and falls within the family\u2019s budget.\nHe accused the journalist of \"mixing up\" trips on official duties with the Prime Minister\u2019s family holidays and said such information was available on open source information such as Parliamentary Questions.\n\"The Prime Minister\u2019s Office follows government guidelines and long-standing procedures adopted for travelling undertaken by the Prime Minister on official trips.

The incident claimed the lives of 38 drivers and a firefighter.\nThe tunnel was closed for more than three years and opened only after extensive repairs and a redesign that included new security measures. Nowadays all merchandise trucks commuting through the tunnel are scanned for heat emissions, he said.\nMr Cilia, who spends a lot of time in Italy on work, said there were plans to excavate an adjacent tunnel to the one under Mont Blanc and another next to the Fr\u00e9jus Road tunnel, which also connects France and Italy.

Would we be able to quickly bring over ferries to cater for the sudden loss of vehicular traffic through the tunnel?\n\u201cAnd if the ferries remain, can the tunnel compete financially with an efficient fleet that could offer trips to different harbours in Malta at a lower price?\u201d\nWhat about a fourth ferry?\n\u201cAs the Gozo Minister Justyne Caruana has explained in the past, if a fourth ferry was adapted to berth at M\u0121arr and \u010airkewwa, there would still be a huge problem: where would it berth at night?\u201d\nFinding a permanent night berth in Grand Harbour and keeping the new ferry at M\u0121arr could be a viable solution, according to Mr Cilia.\nBack in 1990, the Gozo ferry company was operating five vessels, including a fast one between M\u0121arr, Sliema and Sa Maison. Sometimes there were also stops at Marsalforn, Comino and St Paul\u2019s Bay.\nIn 2015 it was decided that the yacht marina at Sa Maison would replace the Gozo Channel berth which had served in the transportation of merchandise to and from Gozo for decades.\n\u201cWhen the Planning Authority gave its go-ahead to the Pieta yacht-marina, it was said that talks were being held with a view to relocating the Gozo Channel berth to the Grand Harbour. This was nearly four years ago. I guess these talks are taking a lot of coffee breaks.\u201d\nThe tunnel is projected to be operational by 2024 but the official underwater geological studies are still to be presented. Will the faults (illustrated in red as per the 2012 Mott MacDonald Assessment of Road Tunnel Options between Malta and Gozo) make the tunnel more difficult to finish in time?\nRead:\u00a0Construction of permanent link between Malta and Gozo unanimously approved", "comment_count": 118, "id": 2718}]
