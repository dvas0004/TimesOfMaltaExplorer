He was a kind man and he was extremely hardworking. He was a builder by profession and had a passion for masonry.

They needed to be encouraged to respect themselves and others by using the proper equipment without this having to be enforced, he said.\nOpposition MP Toni Bezzina said residents had almost become afraid of living in their homes, a situation resulting from the fact that the government had dragged its feet for years.

Dr Borg announced the contentious reform of the regulations governing excavation and demolition works at a press conference, saying the changes would come into force from Tuesday. The main change, he said, would be the creation of site technical officers who would replace site managers.To date, site managers had technically been responsible for ensuring works followed approved plans. However, complaints have arisen that these were not warranted professionals, and could even be the contractors themselves with no technical expertise whatsoever.RELATED STORIESStand your ground when reporting unsafe construction sites, architects toldHow to dig ourselves out of a hole - Chris Mintoff\nTechnical officers to replace site managers\nDr Borg said the new site technical officers would replace site managers and they would have to be warranted architects. They would have to be on site when works are ongoing.\nHowever, they would not have to be the same architect that drafted the plans on the project, and could be appointed by the contractor.\u201cThe word responsibility is at the centre of everything we are trying to achieve here and everyone needs to shoulder their own responsibility in this sector,\u201d he said.\u00a0The government, Dr Borg said, was shouldering its responsibility by legislating, \u201ceven if the reform is tough\u201d.\nThis did not mean the government could satisfy everyone. In fact some might be unhappy with this added responsibility.\nIf some do not want to meet their obligations, they know what to do\n\u201cIf an architect doesn\u2019t want to do this, they can chose not to. But we will not allow a situation where developers are working on a site without the supervision of a warranted professional,\u201d he said, later adding that this would not go down well with the Chamber of Architects who had already expressed concerns.If there were \u201csome\u201d who did not want to meet their obligations, they knew what to do, he said pointedly. Asked if he expected the Chamber of Architects to strike, as had been floated at a recent meeting of professionals, Dr Borg said the ball was in their court. The public, he said, wanted professionals to meet their responsibilities.\nWriting on Facebook, former Chamber president Chris Mintoff said the new legal role of site managers was simply a smoke-screen for contractors' legal and moral obligations, and that the law would only invite more carelessness.\n\"That architects should become complicit in the carelessness of contractors and workers that he did not engage by baby-sitting them is a level of insanity I never thought possible,\" he said.\u00a0\"This law will bring only less peace of mind, security, and far more expenses.\"\n'Radical changes'\nThe minister then went on to detail the \u201cradical changes\u201d when it came to method statements for excavation works, insisting the reform would not allow this document to be vague and unstructured as it was at present. The new legal notice, which will be in Tuesday's Government Gazette, includes schedules that detail how the method statement should be drawn up. \nThis document was sent to the Building Regulations Office and simply filed away. \u201cWe wanted the system to be more transparent. The current situation is not transparent at all,\u201d he said. The document will now be uploaded to the Planning Authority\u2019s map server, meaning the public could now access this detailed document online. A 15-day window will allow any concerned parties to appeal and give input on the works to be done and the methods to be used. The reform will also map out the condition report, which is meant to detail the current state of the site and the neighbouring properties. This would also have to be drafted by a warranted architect.All construction sites, Dr Borg said, would have to comply with the new rules once the legal notice was published tomorrow. In closing, Dr Borg said the legal notice was just a small part of the reform that needed to be carried out to bring the industry up to scratch.\u201cThis is not the entire reform. And I am making this statement in view of some who said this was being rushed,\u201d he said.Some, he added, may have preferred the government to remain silent following the incidents of building collapse.\nThe thriving construction industry has sparked a crisis.\n'We could not keep waiting for accidents to happen'\nDelivering a ministerial statement in Parliament later on Monday, Dr Borg said the changes were part of a long-term effort to reform legislation surrounding the construction industry which had started months earlier, he said, but had been sped up because the government could not stand by and watch accidents happen.\nHe clarified that project architects would not be prohibited from serving as site technical officers themselves. Rather, the new rules mandated that, were an architect to decide against taking on this responsibility himself, his delegate would have to be a warranted architect.\nOpposition Leader Adrian Delia said that safety needed to come first in the construction sector, and that Malta needed to stop reacting to accidents and to start acting to prevent them.\nThe construction industry had developed at a very fast rate in recent years, and the government should have thought about a long-term vision to the development of the sector before instead of \"waiting for accidents to happen\", he added.\n'All stakeholders must show will to change' - Chamber\nThe Chamber of Commerce said in a statement that the reform could only be successful if all stakeholders had the will to change and improve.\u00a0\n\u201cAll along, the Chamber has advocated for the highest of standards in design, engineering, management and construction which must become the true objectives. This reform must be a holistic review of our regulatory and practices framework to truly modernise the industry and change the current situation\u201d it said.\nThe Chamber also warned that the new authority that would be established to amalgamate the various fragmented agencies in the field, must strive to \"regulate and enforce, educate and motivate\" the industry and the public.\u201cThe days of complacency should be long gone. We must not stop once the new authority has been established but we should all strive to ensure that Quality and Safety Targets are met.

The general presumption is that whatever is agreed to, is law to its subject parties, and breach of contract triggers liability to the party in default. Nevertheless, beyond the agreed substance, contract has its own founding principles that would always prevail over and above the said agreed substance.\u00a0\nThere exist four main elements that configure the very core of an agreement. The substance of the contract relies on these elements for their existence, for neither can live while the other survives. Resultantly, the binding chords would be permanently breached if one of the following essential conditions is found to be absent or lacking.\u00a0\nArticle 966 of the Civil Code provides the essential conditions to the validity of the contract, that are: the capacity of the parties to contract; the consent of the party who binds himself; a certain thing which constitutes the subject-matter of the contract; and a lawful consideration.\u00a0\nThis discussion shall delve into the first essential condition \u2013 capacity, for without it, there will be no need to find the other elements. If someone is incapable to stand in contract, the contract fails right away. And indeed, \u2018capacity in contract\u2019 was the essence of the judgment Mario Bugeja vs Bernardette Brincat et, decided by the Civil Hall, First Hall earlier this month.\nSimply put, capacity entails the ability to independently (mentally) take care of one\u2019s own affairs.\u00a0\nThis case related to a dispute between siblings regarding a donation of an immovable property that had been transferred to the defendant by her parents way back in 2009. As it happens, the plaintiff contended that a half undivided share of the said property, which share represented the portion transferred by his mother to the defendant, was null and void. He alleged that his mother had lacked mental capacity at the time the said transfer occurred, and therefore she was incapable of contracting the said donation.\u00a0\nThe defendant pleaded that her mother had been sane and capable, owing to the fact that subsequent to the said transfer she had performed other civil acts \u2013 acts that the plaintiff opted not to impinge.\u00a0\nThe defendant also pleaded nullity of proceedings, since the plaintiff opted to call their mother into suit personally, while at the same time claiming that she lacked mental capacity. This follows the principle that persons who can be sued or sue must always have the ability to take care of their own affairs. Litigants must have contractual capacity, otherwise, they cannot sue or be sued personally.\nTo the defendant, this was a rather contradictory move, since while the plaintiff was stating that his mother was not mentally firm, he was suing her personally as one who can stand in judgment, and therefore as a person who did not suffer from mental infirmity. This plea was eventually resolved because the parties\u2019 mother was interdicted by the Court on the same date of filing, and a curator was appointed in her stead.\u00a0\nNullifying a contract on grounds of incapacity is challenging\nIn determining the parent\u2019s contractual capacity, the Court referred to the applicable provisions of the Civil Code. These essentially provide that any contract that is entered into by a person who lacks the use of reason is null and shall be subject to rescission. Persons who are not capable of understanding owing to some mental defect or who are unable to manifestly express their will are incapable of making donations \u2013 such persons need not necessarily be formally interdicted.\u00a0\nThe Court referred to a previously established judgment, which had listed the fundamental principles that had to be considered in cases that concern the impinging of contracts on the basis of mental incapacities.\nThese principles state that capacity is always presumed, and incapacity is an exception hence the legal presumption favours capacity over incapacity. Nullifying a contract on grounds of incapacity is challenging as the law presumes that everyone has the capacity to contract unless incapacity is unequivocally proven.\u00a0\nThe burden of proof shall be borne by the party who alleges the exception of incapacity and that incapacity must essentially exist at the time of the contract.\u00a0\nCapacity law does not entail that one has to be perfectly and rigorously sane and knowing \u2013 if that were the case, many a person would fail the test. What mattered was that at the time of contract, one possesses the ability to understand the consequences of one\u2019s own actions.\nFurthermore, for insanity to be substantially proven, unequivocal and precise facts must exist, in the sense that any doubts would favour sanity in accordance with the above-mentioned presumption. One may dare say that our jurisprudence requires conclusive proof of insanity, something that goes beyond the balance of probability principle in civil matters.\u00a0\nThe Court also considered that the objective manifestation such as signature and marks, do not guarantee the sanity and capacity of their signatory party.\u00a0\nOne cannot simply regard the external features of consent, that is the markings of the signatory party since capacity is essentially connected with the inner psychological willingness of the party. Capacity, that is, the awareness of one\u2019s wishes, and their corresponding consequences are what drives the willingness of a contracting party.\nTherefore, if a party cannot independently take care of his or her own affairs, his or her will can never be validly crystallised. Persons suffering from such incapacities would not be able to contract since they lack the critical understanding of their own actions.\u00a0\nThe Court found that the mother had been diagnosed with \u201csevere deficits in cognitive function\u201d \u2013 years before the contract of donation. Through the trespass of time, this condition worsened to the extent that medical practitioners had suggested the relocation of the patient to a closed ward.\nThe Court disagreed with the defendant\u2019s submissions, namely that her mother was simply suffering from mere forgetfulness. It held, that from the gathered evidence one could clearly see that such a person was suffering from a ruthless mental condition that had robbed her the capacity to contract. The condition had rendered such patient incapable to the extent that she no longer possessed the necessary use of reason required by law, to be able to contract the donation in question.\u00a0\nConsequently, the Court annulled the transfer of the donated half undivided share and rescinded the donation in part.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nMary Rose Micallef is a junior associate, Azzopardi, Borg, & Abela Advocates.", "comment_count": 2, "id": 674}, {"keywords": "Planning Authority, Environment", "author": "Keith Micallef", "article_body": "In another twist to the Mag\u0127tab fuel station saga, a court declared null all Planning Authority proceedings held after the watchdog had switched its position from against to being in favour of the controversial development.\nThe Planning Authority board will now have to meet again to reconsider the merits of this application.

replacement for ING which announced it was terminating its corresponding banking relationship in December.\nMalta\u2019s biggest local back confirmed last week that its last remaining provider of US dollar transactions would be pulling the plug as part of a de-risking exercise.\nBOV\u2008CEO Mario Mallia\nThe Dutch bank had agreed to pay a \u20ac775 million settlement in a case where it stood accused of widespread breaches of anti-money laundering regulations.\nMalta is increasingly being viewed as a high-risk jurisdiction to do business with, at a time when large correspondent banks are seeking to reduce their exposure to such risks.\nIn an interview with The Sunday Times of Malta, Mr Mallia refuted claims of lax enforcement of Malta\u2019s anti-money laundering laws.\nAdmitting that the jurisdiction as a whole had made mistakes in the past, the BOV CEO said these paled in comparison to recent international scandals involving global banks.\nGaddafi money accepted in different global context\nMr Mallia refused to entertain questions about specific clients when asked about some of BOV\u2019s own recent controversies, including the handling of \u20ac90 million in Gaddafi money, the processing of a \u201csuspicious\u201d transaction in dollars to the company 17 Black and the on-boarding of an Iranian banker who has since been charged with money-laundering in the US.\nHe defended BOV\u2019s track record on the Gaddafi front, saying the money was accepted in different global circumstances, at a time when the strongman was recognised as a legitimate leader and there were no money laundering concerns.\nWhen Libya was slapped with sanctions, BOV promptly froze all the accounts, which remain blocked till this very day.\nBOV to \u2018put its money where its mouth is\u2019\nMr Mallia pointed towards a general shift in the banking sector, which has become more conscious of improving anti-crime defences.\nHe vowed BOV would be putting its money where its mouth is by investing millions in upping its anti-money laundering defences.\nI am obsessed with the long-term\n\u201cBOV is trying to set the standards for Malta when it comes to fighting money laundering. We are very much conscious of our responsibility towards the jurisdiction.\n\u201cThat is why we are investing such large amounts to make BOV and the jurisdiction a much safer place\u201d.\nNews that ING was turning its back on Malta drew a variety of reactions, with Prime Minister Joseph Muscat putting it down to the bank\u2019s success.\nAsked about this particular interpretation, Mr Mallia said BOV\u2019s size had certainly drawn increased regulatory interest. BOV has grown rapidly, both \u201corganically\u201d and because other banks had been shrinking their business.\nMr Mallia said these factors now meant BOV had close to a 50% market share in the local banking sector. Smaller banks have so far largely maintained their correspondent bank relationship, although Malta Bankers\u2019 Association chairman Marcel Cassar warned last week that the ING development was worrying, particularly if it was not driven by any specific problem at BOV.\nSo how come these smaller banks have maintained their US dollar correspondent banks and BOV has been dumped?\nAccording to Mr Mallia, it all boils down to a numbers game. BOV\u2019s large size comparative to other local banks naturally meant correspondent banks viewed it as being higher risk.\nING\u2019s withdrawal comes as \u2018no surprise\u2019\nING\u2019s withdrawal of its correspondent banking services came as no surprise, as it was well known that it was conducting a de-risking exercise, Mr Mallia said.\nHe said efforts were under way to find alternative arrangements.\nDeutsche Bank terminated its servicing of such transactions for BOV two years ago.\nFar from viewing ING\u2019s December withdrawal as a big doomsday clock ticking over his head, Mr Mallia calmly acknowledged the \u201cimportance\u201d of having a US dollar correspondent bank.\n\u201cWe have reasons to be optimistic, although I cannot give any guarantees at this stage. We are seeing interest. There is also a Plan B and a Plan C.\u201d\nAsked what these alternative plans were, Mr Mallia said the bank was working at ensuring that at a minimum, arrangements would be made to service certain important sectors that did business with BOV and traded in US dollars.\nMr Mallia said the vast majority of BOV customers would not be affected by ING\u2019s withdrawal.\n\u201cThere is a very limited connection between the man in the street and US dollars.\u201d\nTwo international firms are helping the bank\nBOV is now embarking on a two-year programme to bolster its anti-money laundering resources and shed the riskier elements of its business.\nMr Mallia said two international firms were helping the bank in its efforts.\nHe said the two-year programme had been embarked upon with the blessing of regulators in Malta and Frankfurt, where the ECB is based.\n\u201cBy the end of this programme, BOV will become one of the safest banks in Europe. This will make future correspondent banking relationships easier than they are today.\n\u201cI am obsessed with the long-term. I will not be reaping the benefits myself of these programmes. I want to leave behind a strong and stable bank,\u201d Mr Mallia said.\nThe function of a correspondent bank\nThe function of a correspondent bank is to conduct business transactions, accept deposits and gather documents on behalf of the other financial institutions, financial advisor Jesmond Mizzi explained to The Sunday Times of Malta.\nSince the European Central Bank started acting as the regulator to a number of banks in Europe, many banks have reduced their service offerings as part of their de-risking programme, Mr Mizzi said.\n\u201cIt is important to note that as far back as November 2015, the World Bank had highlighted the fact that large international banks had started to terminate their correspondent banking relationships with smaller local and regional banks.\nIn March 2017, the International Monetary Fund issued a report in which it was highlighted that restrictions in the appointment of correspondent banks and the termination of existing agreements could have an impact on the growth of such countries, Mr Mizzi said.\nHe said changes in regulations and the more rigorous prudent requirements being implemented by banks were playing an important part in who assists who in the banking sector.\n\u201cIn some way, I think that via the de-risking programme being undertaken by BOV and the more stringent checks and balances in respect of anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism being implemented by all, BOV should be in a better position to find alternative providers for such services.\n\u201cI am sure that the bank is seeking to appoint an alternative correspondent bank and given the bank\u2019s strong profitability and balance sheet, it should be a matter of time before they solve this matter.\u201d\nPotential implications \u2018not critical\u2019\nThe implications for local businesses were not critical given that there were global and local players offering payment services in US Dollars, Mr Mizzi said.\n\u201cThe concern that particular riskier areas of businesses like gaming companies, medical cannabis and cryptocurrency companies would not be able to operate from Malta needs to be evaluated, but I understand that most local banks do not offer services to these companies or if they do, they do not affect payments in US Dollars on behalf of these companies.\u201d\nAs banks de-risked, they stood a better chance of engaging with other international banks, he added.\nMr Mizzi said local authorities also had an important role to play in ensuring that Malta was implementing the necessary regulations in line with other jurisdictions.", "comment_count": 25, "id": 681}, {"keywords": "Politics, Construction, Planning Authority", "author": "Ivan Camilleri", "article_body": "An architect engaged by Infrastructure Minister Ian Borg to submit a controversial development application on his behalf is now serving as a top director within his ministry.\nNadia Gatt Curmi had submitted Dr Borg\u2019s application in 2014 to turn a dilapidated farmhouse in an outside development zone in the limits of Rabat into a 400-square metre home.\nThe 32-year-old architect is now serving as director of Project Design and Engineering at the Ministry for Infrastructure, headed by Dr Borg, The Sunday Times of Malta is informed.\nEarlier in the year, Dr Borg appointed the architect as director on the newly formed roads agency, Infrastructure Malta.\nA few years ago, when Dr Borg was defending himself in front of the Commission against Corruption over allegations of wrongdoing to obtain his home\u2019s permit, he had cited his architect\u2019s \u201cinexperience\u201d as proof that he did not wield any political influence.\nRELATED STORIESNo swimming pool for Ian Borg\n\u201cParliamentary Secretary (now Minister) Ian Borg said he had met his architect, Nadia Curmi, who used to work with a private company, and that she was appointed directly by him,\u201d the commission\u2019s report states.\nAt the time, he denied using any influence or abuse of power to obtain his permit.\n\u201cIf I had to use such influence, I would not have appointed an architect with no experience,\u201d he told the commission.

But they are having to deal with a double blow: the challenging condition his younger sister is also facing. They tell Fiona Galea Debono they will never stop looking for opportunities to improve their children\u2019s future.\nAll children are special and unique \u2013 but siblings Luke and Chrissy Pitt happen to both have conditions that make them that precious one in 250,000 and one in 30,000 respectively.\nWhen Luke was born with a bowed leg, his parents Audrey and John did not think much of it \u2013 it was quite normal and was meant to straighten, or so they thought.\nAt six months, however, he was diagnosed with Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1), a genetic disorder of the nervous system that afflicts one in 3,000 births, and in Luke\u2019s case, developed from a spontaneous mutation in the genes. But it did not stop there\u2026\nIn extremely rare cases, NF-1 can also cause limb deformities, and the cherub-like baby\u2019s leg bone was surrounded by tumorous tissue that ate away at it.\u00a0\nStrong and determined, the parents left no stone unturned to find the best possible treatment for their son. They embarked on a journey to see Luke, now five, run freely, and this summer, they are travelling back to the US for two more operations.\nAt first, their research proved disheartening. They were facing one of the most challenging orthopaedic surgeries to treat the disease effectively, as well as plenty of ensuing complications, including a high re-fracture rate and loss of union of the tibia.\u00a0\nShockingly, they also discovered that, in the UK, where they sought medical advice, most parents had opted for amputation for their children. But Audrey and John simply would not accept that path for Luke and their determination and hope led them to look for other routes.\nIn Germany, expected results from the more advanced methods to treat the disease would still have posed many limitations for the then three-year-old boy, who would have had to wear a brace for the rest of his life, while spending a year with a bulky external fixator to grow the bone.\nThis also meant his parents would have to turn its screws every six hours, resulting in loss of muscle and the possibility of infection.\nWanting the best for their child, they explored the possibility of treatment by world-renowned orthopaedic surgeon Dr Dror Paley, whose name and his 100 per cent success rate had been popping up in their connections via Facebook with other parents in the same situation.\nJohn and Audrey speak.\nThey went from the bleak prospect of amputation to the promise of bone union and no refractures.\nNonetheless, Audrey admits it was the longest and toughest decision the family ever had to make.\nIn February 2017, Luke underwent a life-changing, five-and-a-half-hour surgery, which culminated in \u201ca look of pride in Dr Paley\u2019s eyes\u201d when he emerged from surgery that Audrey can never forget.\nToday, despite what the family is about to go through again in the next stage of treatment, she feels serene about Luke\u2019s condition and is raring to get it done, knowing that the right treatment has been found and taking the whole experience in her stride.\nThe Pitt family: Luke, John, Audrey and Chrissy. Both children have unrelated, rare genetic conditions. Photos:\u2008Chris Sant Fournier\nI couldn\u2019t believe our daughter was diagnosed with a separate unrelated genetic condition just as we thought we finally had things under control with Luke\nBut she admits the second blow, dealt by Chrissy\u2019s condition, diagnosed when she was one, was a bitter pill to swallow \u2013 she could not believe the saga had not ended with Luke\u2019s ordeal.\n\u201cI had accepted Luke\u2019s situation but I couldn\u2019t believe that our daughter was diagnosed with a separate unrelated genetic condition just as we thought we finally had things under control with Luke. What were the chances?\u201d\nThe family had to face a barrage of new medical terms they had never heard of as Chrissy was diagnosed with an imbalance of chromosome 8, which means she is globally delayed, intellectually and physically.\nA placid baby and a godsend, it soon turned out that her quiet nature was not what it seemed and that something was not quite right with her development.\nThings came to head just before the Pitts travelled to the US for Luke to undergo his first operation. She was left behind with her grandmother for further investigations at Mater Dei.\nChrissy was diagnosed with motor-planning difficulties and the family\u2019s focus soon shifted to her and the need to provide continuous therapy for the now three-year-old to help her overcome her challenges and be able to achieve independent walking and speech.\nIn truth, while Chrissy is a determined, hard-working child, her condition is even more complicated than Luke\u2019s. \u201cI wish I had the solution for her that we have for my son. We now know that by 16, once he reaches bone maturity age, Luke will remove the leg brace he wears for protection when he goes out.\n\u201cBut Chrissy\u2019s condition is neurological, and apart from therapy and the constant input from the family and her LSE to improve her independence, there is little else we can do...\n\u201cI worry about her needs when we are not around anymore, so now is the time to help her to be semi-independent at least by being able to make herself a piece of toast and a cup of tea in the future\u2026\u201d\nThe family struggled with the idea of publicising their story to protect their children\u2019s privacy but eventually, strengthened by others\u2019 support, they decided to go for it to raise both money and awareness about these conditions.\n\u201cDuring our research, we met so many families who are in the same boat and we drew so much support and information from them. Now, it is our turn to give back to those who are wondering what direction to take.\u201d\nLuke\u2019s first surgery in Florida cost \u20ac115,000, which the working parents self-funded, thanks also to the support of family and friends.\n\nThe upcoming surgeries involve the removal of metal work in the leg that has done its job and the replacement of telescopic rods that grow with Luke and have reached their maximum length, as well as tackling an ankle issue. And the bill will amount to \u20ac67,000, excluding travel and accommodation expenses.\nMoreover, Chrissy\u2019s 10 weekly therapy sessions cost them an additional \u20ac12,000 a year.\nThey are grateful to anyone who has helped them in their journey so far and have now set up a fundraising philanthropic entity and campaign through a temporary voluntary organisation, A Better Life for Luke Association, complete with a website and Facebook page that is being launched today to guide people to contribute further.\nLuke has asked to \u201ccancel the operation\u201d, but his parents reassure him of their support. Sometimes, he asks them why the other children are running away from him, and they explain that they are only running faster.\nDespite these concerns \u2013 and the fact that before the first operation, Luke suffered to walk \u2013 his leg has healed well and the bone has strengthened and joined. He is determined to jump and is constantly practising, but otherwise, he is doing pretty much what other children his age do\u2026\nOnly last month, Luke participated in his school\u2019s Sports Day. Few parents and children there would have noticed what a massive milestone that was for the boy and his family. And the fact that they didn\u2019t is actually a good thing.\nIt is testament to the unstinting efforts of his parents to give their son a leg-up in the race of life and remove any stumbling blocks along the way. Luke could run with his friends, and although most would take that for granted, for the Pitts, the racecourse has been much longer and the hurdles higher.\n\u201cIt all feels very unreal, but we will continue to do the best for both our children. Our promise to them is that we will never stop looking for opportunities to give them a better life.\u201d\nYou can help too\nTo contribute to Luke\u2019s medical bills, check out www.abetterlifeforluke.com and Facebook page A better life for Luke.

Opening breastfeeding clinics in the community would offer accessible support to struggling mothers and improved follow-ups would increase the breastfeeding rate.\nOther services that would work well in the community include: parentcraft classes, sexual health, reproductive health and family planning and antenatal care. By fulfilling an educational role, midwives would also help address nutrition and obesity that often lead to gestational diabetes, as well as other health issues such as smoking cessation.\nThey would also offer more support to migrant women who are often unaware of the services they are entitled to.\u00a0\nMaternal mental health\nMidwives could also support more on a mental health level. \u201cOur midwives are trained in perinatal (during and after pregnancy) mental health and we have a perinatal mental health clinic at the hospital.

Then there are the women who experienced previous mental health issues,\u201d she said.\nAll these services, she said, would also need to be offered during hours that make sense for working women. Prof. Borg Xuereb believes this is achievable with long-term planning: \u201cIf we don\u2019t have the resources today, we will within a few years. At present, the midwifery course has an intake of 15 students per year, but we have many more applicants each year, so we can increase the intake of students given that we will have more services,\u201d she said.\nShe added that having children was important for the country. Malta\u2019s fertility rate stands at 1.42 and needs to increase to at least 2.1 to be sustainable.\n\u201cThe State needs to take care of the health of mothers and of their families, this is essential for the country.
