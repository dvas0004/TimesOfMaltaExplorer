She extended her hand into the lion\u2019s cage in an attempt to stroke it. True to its primal instincts, the big cat grabbed the lady\u2019s hand in its powerful jaws and mauled her arm, causing her substantial injuries.\nShe sued the lion\u2019s owner, claiming that it was he who had encouraged her to stroke the lion, and therefore he was to be blamed for the accident. Presumably, she was acting in terms of Article 1040 of the Civil Code, which states that the owner of an animal, or any person using an animal during such time as such person is using it, shall be liable for any damage caused by it, whether the animal was under his charge or had strayed or escaped.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the defence brought forward by the respondent was that the injury suffered by the plaintiff was self-inflicted; in other words, he pleaded to the rule known by the Latin maxim volenti non fit iniuria.\nUnder our law, fault is a tricky concept. It is generally stated (in Article 1031 of the Civil Code) that every person shall be liable for the damage that occurs through his fault. It is further stated in Article 1032 (1) of the Civil Code that a person shall be deemed to be at fault if, in his own acts, he does not use the prudence, diligence, and attention of a bonus paterfamilias (a standard of care analogous to that of \u2018the reasonable man\u2019).\nIn tort (personal injury) cases, fault is often the principal contention; parties often entertain contradicting versions as to who is to be blamed for the event causing the injuries. But sometimes, one finds oneself asking deeper questions, such as: What if the event is not the respondent\u2019s fault? What if it was the injured person\u2019s fault? What if the injured person appearing as the plaintiff willingly and knowingly assumed predictable risks inherent to the activity in which he was participating at the time of his injury?\nThe plaintiff\u2019s behaviour \u2013 albeit foolish \u2013 was hers and hers only\nSimply put, the doctrine of volenti non fit iniuria states that if someone volunta\u00adrily places himself in a position where he knows that some degree of harm might result, he may not subsequently bring an action in tort against a third party. It exonerates that person who would otherwise be deemed to be responsible, for the fact that the victim would have knowingly assumed a certain level of risk for that act that caused the injury.\nThis is not a new concept; indeed, it can be traced back to ancient times, in the maxim famously formulated by the great Roman jurist, Ulpian: nulla iniuria est, qu\u00e6 in volentem fiat (meaning: \u2018no injustice is done to someone who wants that thing done\u2019).\nThis defence is somewhat similar to another defence often brought forward in tort cases, that of \u2018contributory negligence\u2019. This is provided for in Article 1051 of the Civil Code, which states that if the party injured has by his imprudence, negligence or want of attention contributed or given occasion to the damage, the court, in assessing the amount of damages payable to him, shall determine, in its discretion, the proportion in which he has so contributed or given occasion to the damage which he has suffered, and the amount of damages payable to him by such other persons as may have maliciously or invo\u00adluntarily contributed to such damage, shall be reduced accordingly.\nThe resemblance is apparent, but nevertheless, the legal difference is noteworthy. When one pleads \u2018contributory negligence\u2019, it means that one is stating that the claimant contributed to the damage suffered thereby and that the damages awarded are to be reduced in proportion to that fault, usually manifested in a percentage number which is cut from the compensation awarded (in proportion to the apportioned blame). The defence of volenti non fit iniuria is different; it is a \u2018complete\u2019 defence, in the sense that it seeks to totally exculpate defendant from any liability whatsoever.\nThe court considered in this case that there was no doubt that the plaintiff was aware of the possible consequences of putting one\u2019s hand into a lion\u2019s cage. She knew what could (or rather, would) happen, yet she decided to reach into the cage nevertheless, voluntarily assuming certain risks inherent to that same act. It found that it seldom mattered whether the respondent had encouraged her to do so, as the lion\u2019s reaction was to be expected.\nThe lion was confined into a cage for a reason, and it was rather obvious that the lion would not react graciously to an unfamiliar intruder. As the saying goes \u2013 true, the lion is a mighty, noble animal, but it is an animal nevertheless!\nThe court found that the plaintiff had not managed to prove that the respondent had in any way acted in an illicit manner. The lion was properly registered and well maintained. There was nothing to indicate that the respondent had in any way forced the plaintiff to reach into the cage, and ultimately, the plaintiff\u2019s behaviour \u2013 albeit foolish \u2013 was hers and hers only. She had acted with a profuse lack of prudence, so much so that she had voluntarily placed herself into unnecessary risk and danger.\nTherefore, if there was anyone to blame, it was the plaintiff.\nIn conclusion, the court moved to reject plaintiff\u2019s request for damages, and also ordered her to pay the costs of the case.\nCarlos Bugeja is senior associate at Azzopardi, Borg & Abela Advocates.", "comment_count": 12, "id": 2329}, {"keywords": "Health, Crime", "author": "", "article_body": "Doctors For Life has challenged the Office of the Commissioner for Children to take an unequivocal stand to protect the unborn child, saying that recent reports indicate that the current position might be \u201cwavering\u201d.\nThe Commissioner for Children\u2019s chief function, according to the law, is to \u201cpromote special care and protection, including adequate legal protection, for children both before and after birth\u201d.\nLovinMalta recently reported that the Commissioner had tentatively given a green light for the government to adopt the UN\u2019s recommendations for adolescent girls to have safe access to abortion and post-abortion services.RELATED STORIESDecriminalisation of abortion recommended\nDoctors For Life said in a statement that, since human life begins at fertilisation, the pre-born child was deserving of the full protection of the law.\n\"This is clearly the case here in Malta.

Controversy has dogged Dr Lia\u2019s appointment since it emerged that he has represented the Prime Minister as his private lawyer in the past, and more recently after his daughter-in-law, Nadine Lia, was appointed to the bench on April 25.\nThe source close to the ECtHR said that the presence of litigating or prosecuting lawyers on bodies that appoint or sanction the judiciary would work against Malta in potential cases taken to Strasbourg for breach of fair-trial provisions.\nMalta has one of the worst track records in Strasbourg: recent analysis by Judge Emeritus Giovanni Bonello showed that nine out of 10 cases are lost by the Maltese government.\nChamber president\u00a0 on \u2018intellectual integrity\u2019 of judiciary\nThe president of the Chamber of Advocates, Louis de Gabriele, took a line implicitly critical of the constitutional lawsuit of Repubblika in his speech during the recent inaugural session of one of the latest judicial appointees. The NGO has filed an ongoing constitutional challenge to the system of judicial appointments, including the latest complement of appointees, within the context of judicial independence and fair-trial provisions. Dr de Gabriele said that any reform to the system of judicial appointments is \u201ca political matter\u201d and \u201cgreat care is needed before attempting to address it via judicial process.\u201d Asked to elaborate in view of the fact that justice experts have been telling this newspaper that the constitutional court is an appropriate venue for Repubblika\u2019s challenge, Dr de Gabriele said the issue \u201ccan only properly be dealt with by the political class. Even if, hypothetically, a court were to find merit in the Repubblika case, it is still the political class that will have to fashion a remedy if the law in its current state were to be found wanting.\u201d The Sunday Times of Malta has also in recent weeks carried reports in which experts in EU law \u2013 including Monica Claes, a Dutch professor who has authored many papers on EU constitutionalism \u2013 have said that Repubblika\u2019s request in front of Malta\u2019s constitutional court deserves to be settled at the European Court of Justice. In his expanded comments on the subject, Dr de Gabriele maintained that \u201cit would be an over-simplification to equate judicial independence simply to the mechanism of appointment\u201d, even if it\u2019s \u201calbeit a fundamental feature.\u201d In his speech and comments he alluded to the \u201cintellectual integrity\u201d of the judiciary several times as another measure of judicial independence. In one instance in his speech he talked of \u201can important tradition\u201d of the judiciary showing the \u201cintellectual integrity\u201d to transcend any predilections or sensibilities of their former roles, and maintained that he had \u201cno doubt\u201d that the new judge in front of him, Joanne Vella Cuschieri, would live up to that tradition. This is an allusion to the political party provenance of much of Malta\u2019s judiciary.Madame Justice Vella Cuschieri was a failed Labour election candidate in 2013 before being appointed magistrate in 2014. She has since build a reputation in court for being decisive, hard-working and for not taking nonsense from lawyers or litigants. In its jurisprudence, the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) talks of two measures of judicial impartiality in respect of possible breaches of fair-trial provisions: the \u201csubjective\u201d or personal prejudice of the judge as well as \u201cthe requirement of objective impartiality\u201d that is a correlate between the manner of judicial appointments and judicial impartiality. The ECtHR elaborates that \u201cto establish\u201d whether a court \u201ccan be considered independent, regard must be had, inter alia, to the manner of appointment of its members and their term of office, the existence of safeguards against external pressure and the question whether the body presents an appearance of independence\u201d.It adds that \u201ceven appearances may be of a certain importance or, in other words, \u2018justice must not only be done, it must also be seen to be done\u2019. What is at stake is the confidence which the courts in a democratic society must inspire in the public\u201d.In his speech Dr de Gabriele echoed the criticism of the government\u2019s discretion in making judicial appointees and talked of the \u201csuperior model of lessened participation by the executive organ\u201d. This chimes with the Venice Commission\u2019s exhortation of the \u201cpotential political influence\u201d on the judiciary though the Prime Minister\u2019s \u201cpower to influence [judicial] appointment\u201d. The current system has also been faulted for shallowness of the assessment criteria, absence of competition among candidates for specific vacant posts, and the opacity and composition of the assessing body. In contrast to increasingly impatient criticism from other justice experts, Dr de Gabriele\u2019s criticism of the system of judicial appointments is comparably muted. He points out that it \u201chas been with us since independence\u201d, it has \u201cserved its purpose well over time\u201d, and then adds that \u201cit can, like any other system, be improved.\u201dIn other comments that are incongruous with the spirit of jurisprudence of the ECtHR, he also told The Sunday Times of Malta he does \u201cnot believe there is any conflict of interest at all\u201d in his participation, by virtue of being president of the Chamber, on the committee that assesses candidates for judicial office and promotion, as well as the body that hears appeals to disciplinary decisions on the judiciary.", "comment_count": 11, "id": 2339}, {"keywords": "Construction, Justice", "author": "Ivan Martin", "article_body": "Architects would have to report on the measures being taken to protect neighbouring buildings from demolition and excavation works, under proposed laws to be published on Monday.\nThe legal amendments were drafted by the authorities and sent to industry stakeholders last week following a series of consultative meetings.\u00a0\nThe recommendations come at the end of a week which saw a building collapse in Mellie\u0127a and the wall of another fall apart in Guardamangia.

Architects have also called an extraordinary general meeting of the chamber for this Friday.\nThe KTP is also holding talks with various industry stakeholders about its reform proposals.\nFurther meetings are also scheduled to take place with the Chamber of Engineers, the Chamber of Commerce and the Building Industry Consultative Council.\n\u201cThe events of the past weeks have thrown a spotlight on the industry as a whole, including on the profession, which most certainly has its own responsibilities to carry with regard to the current state of affairs, as do all the other operators involved,\u201d the KTP said.\n\u201cThe issues we are facing are complex, and the fast pace of the industry is stretching resources beyond capacity, yet none of this justifies relaxation of standards and lack of diligence.\u201d\nA historical note\nThis is not the first time that the authorities have been called upon to halt works on construction sites on the back of serious incidents.\u00a0\nTurn the clock back more than 100 years to October 1914 and the then Instituto dei Periti Architetti (Institute of architects) had written to the Chief Secretary to Government, requesting legal intervention.\u00a0\nWriting in Italian, the institute had said that \u201cgiven the repeated disasters\u201d that had occurred due to buildings being built without an architect\u2019s guidance, the government should intervene.\nA unanimous vote among architects at the time had called for no permit requests for buildings or other edifices to be considered unless underwritten by an architect.\nThey had also called for building works conducted without the direction of an architect to be considered illegal and for the authorities to intervene in such cases.\nAD\u2019s reaction\nBuilding industry regulators are little more than \u201cletterboxes\u201d set up to receive reports, Alternattiva Demokratika said on Saturday.\n\u201cBuilding industry regulatory authorities do not have the resources to carry out their responsibilities, which they have abdicated,\u201d AD chairman Carmel Cacopardo said at a press conference in Guardamangia.\nThe government, he said, would now be rushing through emergency regulations in the coming days.

Malta Air was set up following agreement with the government, which has welcomed it into the market.\nHowever, pilots are expressing concerns. \u201cWe are mostly worried not because of the new airline, as Ryanair has been here for many years,\u201d a cockpit veteran said.\n\u201cWe are more concerned about the government\u2019s real intentions over this deal, teaming up (it has 1 Ordinary B share in the new airline) with a company which has practically brought Air Malta to its knees,\u201d he told The Sunday Times of Malta.\n\u201cThe problem is not competition,\u201d said a first officer. \u201cThe real problem is the long-term hidden agenda. We are not stupid. Malta Air \u2013 or Air Malta in reverse \u2013 will slowly dilute the national airline and make us irrelevant. The unwritten intention is to drive us out of the market. A slow death.\u201d\nSo far in the highly unionised national airline, only ALPA appears to have expressed worries about this major development in the local aviation sector. The GWU, which represents the bulk of the airline\u2019s staff, has not yet voiced any concerns and neither have the cabin crew and engineers\u2019 unions.\nFollowing the Malta Air announcement last week, the government, through Air Malta chairman Charles Mangion, a political appointee, met the unions individually to reassure them that Malta Air will not compete with Air Malta. He is expected to tell the pilots the same thing on Tuesday.\nWhat\u2019s the deal?\nRyanair, the most successful of low-cost carriers, has been operating in Malta for at least a decade. It offers cheap flights to many destinations, eating away at Air Malta\u2019s market share, which as a legacy carrier cannot compete despite changing its business model.\nRyanair operates six planes in Malta, flying to 61 destinations. Over the past few years it has surpassed Air Malta in the number of passengers carried in and out of the country, despite the fact that Air Malta also increased the number of passengers and destinations, save for a period when the government was trying to shrink the airline to sell it to Alitalia.\nThrough the new deal with the government, the six Ryanair planes will be painted with Malta Air colours \u2013 the same red and white used by the national airline, together with a similar logo \u2013 the Maltese cross \u2013 used on Air Malta tails.\nExperts describe the livery and the name of the new Ryanair subsidiary as \u201ca clone of Air Malta,\u201d deliberately chosen. According to the few details given, it will register its planes in Malta while its 350-strong staff manning the current fleet, will pay taxes in Malta.\nWhat will Ryanair change?\nSo far nothing \u2013 just its marketing which will be boasting some connections identical to Air Malta\u2019s. In the long term, Ryanair intends to boost its Malta Air fleet to 10 planes \u2013 a similar number to Air Malta\u2019s \u2013 and increase flight frequency and destinations.\nIt will also look to having the maintenance of its planes carried out in Malta. The service is already offered by Lufthansa Tecknik and SR Technics to several other airlines.\nAccording to experts, this could possibly lead to the future \u201csale\u201d of Air Malta\u2019s hangars and engineering team. The government already had plans to hive off these facilities.\nWas government needed?\nNo. Ryanair is much bigger than Air Malta and generates a turnover of nearly \u20ac7.5 billion.\nAn industry expert who spoke to The Sunday Times of Malta described the new partnership as \u201cvery strange\u201d \u2013 the Maltese government is the largest shareholder in Air Malta and Ryanair is its largest and harshest competitor.\nAir Malta employees who spoke to this newspaper expressed their disbelief that one of their own directors, Ronald Mizzi, had signed the deal with Ryanair on behalf of the government as Tourism Minister Konrad Mizzi\u2019s Permanent Secretary.\n\u201cThey really have lost the meaning of conflicts of interest,\u201d a senior Air Malta official observed.\nUnder EU rules, Ryanair could have done whatever it did without the permission or involvement of the Maltese government.\nWhat\u2019s in it for the government and Ryanair?\nAccording to experts, the deal is \u201can excellent one\u201d for Ryanair as it has tied the government\u2019s hands whenever it needs any form of support. Ryanair already benefits from millions of euros in subsidies from Maltese taxpayers given in the form of \u201cmarketing\u201d help whenever they open a new route, in order to get around EU competition rules.\nUnder this deal, Ryanair would find it easier to \u201cpull strings\u201d at the Malta Tourism Authority if it needed to, an aviation expert said. At the same time, despite what the government is describing as \u201ca golden share\u201d, it will have absolutely nothing to do with the running of Malta Air.\nMalta Air is formed of 150,000 Ordinary A shares owned by Gulliver Holding Ltd \u2013 a Ryanair subsidiary \u2013 and just one Ordinary B share held by the Tourism Ministry.\nWhile the government has accepted that it will not be represented on the airline\u2019s board of directors, and is a dormant shareholder, it only tied Ryanair to the condition that it will need the government\u2019s permission to change the name of the airline.\nHowever, Ryanair is not tied down by any conditions on how and when to invest \u2013 it can always decide to close down Malta Air and open a new airline with a new name.\nCan the airlines co-exist?\nSome experts have their doubts, particularly due to the constraints of the Maltese market, even though on paper there is nothing precluding this. Despite Prime Minster Joseph Muscat\u2019s reassurances that the two airlines will not compete against each other, the reality may be quite different.\n\u201cDo not buy what Dr Muscat is saying,\u201d one expert said. \u201cRyanair and Malta Air will fly to Rome, London, Catania and Brussels, sometimes to different airports but to the same destinations. These are among Air Malta\u2019s most popular routes. Through the new airline, and now with the help of the government, Malta Air will eat further into Air Malta\u2019s pie. That is obvious.\u201d\nMissing details?\nThe deal is seen by some as a long-term strategy to let Air Malta die a natural death and re-open a new Maltese airline.\n\u201cObviously, Malta cannot depend on Malta Air (Ryanair in disguise). At the same time, Air Malta as it is cannot survive,\u201d one expert argued.\n\u201cOur reading of the latest development is quite clear. It\u2019s a long-term plan for Air Malta to shut down and transfer operations to a new airline in a seamless, undisrupted way. That will give the government the opportunity to have a new airline, with fewer staff, higher efficiency, new working conditions and less unions.\n\u201cSo far the deal looks excellent for Ryanair, good for Malta\u2019s tourism industry, bad for Air Malta and disastrous for its employees\u2019 future. Obviously, no government will admit this plan, openly.\u201d\nNeither the government nor Ryanair answered questions sent by The Sunday Times of Malta until the time of writing.", "comment_count": 80, "id": 2341}, {"keywords": "Health, Society", "author": "Sarah Carabott", "article_body": "Widows are at a higher risk of suicide than widowed men, according to figures from the last 24 years.\nThe study looked at completed suicides in Malta between 1995 and 2018.

So Prof. Deidun expects such blooms to all but disappear in the coming days and weeks.\nThe jellyfish species spectrum, he said, was very broad and local populations were not solely composed of the mauve stinger.\n\u201cIn recent weeks, in fact, many have observed the washing up on our beaches of what looks like a giant sheet of plastic, which in reality consists of loads of dead by-the-wind sailors (Velella velella), which are endowed with a bright indigo colour when they are alive.\u201d\nThe frequency and magnitude of jellyfish blooms has increased in recent decades\nThese colonies of polyps are propelled by a \u2018sail\u2019 protruding out of the water consisting of chitin, the same stuff insect wings are composed of.\nThese \u2018living sailing boats\u2019 (tellingly known as \u2018qlug\u0127\u2019 in Maltese) normally appear much earlier in the season, once again in testimony to the inherent response of jellyfish communities to variability in climactic conditions.\u00a0\nThere are approximately 50 jellyfish species recorded to date in Maltese waters and, with the exception of a few \u2013 such as the mauve stinger \u2013 most of these species appear at specific periods of the year, such as the fried egg jellyfish (qassata in Maltese), which normally blooms during the lampuki fishing season in late summer.\nBy-the-wind sailor.\nJellyfish, Prof. Deidun said, have been blooming since time immemorial, \u201cas records maintained in the Mediterranean since the 1800s for the mauve stinger aptly show\u201d.\nHowever, it is true that the frequency and magnitude of jellyfish blooms has increased in recent decades.\nHe is also keen to dispel the belief that all jellyfish species are stingers, insisting the vast majority are not.\nThe stingers one should steer clear of are the mauve stinger, the Portuguese man o\u2019 war (which is actually a colony and not a single jellyfish and which is responsible for the only fatality known from a jellyfish sting in the Mediterranean), the box jellyfish (common in yacht marinas) and the nomadic jellyfish, an alien species native of the Indian Ocean.\nThe remaining 30 to 40 species present in Maltese waters, Prof. Deidun said, are \u201cpretty much innocuous\u201d.", "comment_count": 6, "id": 2348}, {"keywords": "Construction, Guardamangia, Accident", "author": "Denise Grech ", "article_body": "Traumatised residents have been waking up in shock and reliving the terror of Thursday\u2019s collapse of an apartment block wall bordering a construction site.\nThis was the third such incident in a few months, leading to the evacuation of 16 adults and two children living in the block of five apartments on Mimosa Street, Guardamangia.
