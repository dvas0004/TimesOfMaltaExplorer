The son was born just a few months after his father\u2019s disappearance.\nLegal sources told the Times of Malta that although the \u2018political murders\u2019 during Dom Mintoff\u2019s era remained unsolved, most of the heirs of the victims were compensated by the State. These included the heirs of Karen Grech killed by a letter bomb in 1977 during an ongoing doctors\u2019 strike, and of Raymond Caruana, a Nationalist Party activist who was fatally wounded when shots were fired at the Gudja PN club in late 1986.\nHolding the State responsible for the \u2018political\u2019 murder, perpetrated by a tense political climate, rampant corruption and the failure of institutions, Mr Cauchi\u2019s heirs noted that informal talks on compensation were never concluded.\u00a0\nAccusing the government of never really investigating the brutal murder in a proper manner, thus breaching the Constitution, Ms Cassar and her son called upon the Prime Minister to proceed in granting them compensation they were eligible to.\nThe brutal murder of Lino Cauchi\nIn the late 1970s\u00a0and early 1980s, Mr Cauchi was among the handful of accounting practitioners on the island. At the time, the island was experiencing very turbulent political times, dominated by rampant institutionalised corruption.\nAmong Mr Cauchi\u2019s clients was a group of people connected to Mr Sant, the only high-profile Maltese politician ever to be found involved in corruption by the Permanent Commission Against Corruption.\n\nIn December 1981, days before a tense general election, Mr Cauchi was called for a meeting at the office of the late Joe Pace, owner of the Magic Kiosk in Sliema, when, according to court evidence, the accountant was instructed to draft various promises of sale agreements on the transfer of land to members of Mr Sant\u2019s clique. The evidence also indicated that Mr Cauchi had objected to what was being done and, after he had left the meeting, one of those present had remarked Mr Cauchi was a problem.\nTwo months later, in the morning of February 14, 1982, the 32-year-old accountant left his home in Santa Venera for his office in Valletta and never returned.\nAt the time, Mrs Cauchi, pregnant with their son, believed her husband had been kidnapped.\nMr Cauchi was last seen in Old Bakery Street, Valletta, at 6.30 pm but his car, for some unknown reason, was found parked outside his residence at about 4pm, when he was in Valletta.\nA suitcase he carried when he last left home was found empty at Chadwick Lakes two days later. It was forced open.\nIt later resulted that Mr Cauchi had a similar suitcase at his home and had warned his wife not to let go of it should anything ever happen to him. The day after his disappearance, a man identifying himself as Inland Revenue Department official appeared at Ms Cauchi\u2019s door asking for the suitcase. The distraught woman handed it over to him. The department later denied ever sending anyone to pick the suitcase.\nMore than three years later, on November 15, 1985, the remains of a human body were found by the police in a shallow well in the area known as Il-Bosk, near Buskett Gardens in Rabat. They were later identified as Mr Cauchi.\nAccording to forensic expert Anthony Abela Medici, who had studied the case at the time, although it was difficult to establish when Mr Cauchi was killed, forensic evidence indicated his body was dismembered, packed in plastic bags and dumped in the well within 30 minutes of the murder.\nIt was established Mr Cauchi had been killed with a blow to the right hand side of his head by a mallet, which was also found in the well. According to Dr Abela Medici, the strong blow fractured the skull in 28 places and could have been fatal. Forensic evidence suggested that more than one individual could have been involved in the killing because of the short time span it took for the body to be cut up, packed and dumped. Both a manual and an electric saw were used to cut up the body.\nCourt evidence on a number of corruption cases in the 1980s had indicated that Mr Cauchi was privy to corrupt dealings by a number of businessmen, including Mr Sant\u2019s right-hand man and works manager, Pio Camilleri.\nHe was identified by at least two court witnesses as Mr Camilleri\u2019s accountant. However, Mr Camilleri has consistently denied ever knowing Mr Cauchi.\nAlthough the murder remains a mystery, it is widely believed it could have been linked to the late accountant\u2019s knowledge of corrupt dealings.\n\u00a0", "comment_count": 192, "id": 526}, {"keywords": "", "author": "Claire Caruana", "article_body": "Students who left school early, without obtaining any qualifications, often felt \u201cshortchanged\u201d by an education system that did not properly acknowledge their learning difficulties, according to a new study.\nConducted by the National Observatory for Living with Dignity, the study, being published tomorrow, is also set to reveal that students whose parents get a divorce were more likely to drop out of school without any qualifications.\nObservatory chairman Carmel Borg told the Times of Malta the study would confirm there were moments in the lives of those interviewed where they felt they had been shortchanged by a system that did not properly acknowledge and provide for their learning difficulties and let them drift away from the targets set for the compulsory school system.\n\u201cThe system also tracked or streamed them early until they became a self-fulfilling prophecy and they were rarely helped in properly transitioning from home to school given the social and cultural gap that defined home-school relations,\u201d Prof. Borg said.\nProf. Borg said the break-up of parents\u2019 marriage could cause the most profound emotional trauma and leave the biggest impact on children, particularly in low socio-economic status contexts defined by limited social and cultural capital.\n\u201cChildren living in families where parents are divorced are often in constant, apparent or hidden mourning that often leads to early school-leaving,\u201d he noted.\nThe issue, he commented, threw light on the importance of emotional stability within the family unit because there was a very strong link between such stability and potential for the child\u2019s holistic development.

The copy was then handed over to the Prime Minister and the Justice Minister.\nOn July 22, the Attorney General\u2019s office published a 49-page document containing the conclusions of the inquiry. Immediately afterwards, the Prime Minister addressed a press conference saying the inquiry found that Egrant did not belong to either him or his wife. He reiterated his intention of publishing the report.\nA week later, a spokesman for the Office of the Prime Minister told The Sunday Times of Malta the report would be released in \u201ca matter of days\u201d because government officials and lawyers were redacting the document to make sure no third party names or anything that could prejudice further investigations were published.\nOn October 26, 2018, following a court case filed by the Opposition demanding the release of the report, the Prime Minster insisted he was still in favour of the publication of the full report.\nHowever, he declared this would not be done until a decision was made by the court hearing the case instituted by the Opposition.\nivan.camilleri@timesofmalta.com", "comment_count": 40, "id": 530}, {"keywords": "", "author": "", "article_body": "The police have arrested two men from Serbia and another from North Macedonia after finding them in possession of drugs.\nThe arrests stemmed from investigations after an Albanian man reported that he was assaulted earlier this month.\nThe arrests were made in a house in Msida.\nThe men were found in possession of cannabis and cocaine.

The authors acknowledged a degree of uncertainty to their estimates, which, when taken into account, provide a range of between 473 and 677 early deaths per year in Malta.\n\u201cImproving European air quality is an achievable, highly effective and, therefore, imperative health promotion intervention,\u201d the authors added.\u00a0\n\u201cBy replacing fossil energy sources with clean, renewable fuels, the attributable mortality rate in Europe could be reduced by 55 per cent.\n\u201cFurther reductions are feasible by additionally controlling other industrial and agricultural pollution sources.\u201d", "comment_count": 105, "id": 558}, {"keywords": "", "author": "Denise Grech ", "article_body": "The parliamentary secretary responsible for citizenship on Wednesday denied that a man described as having blown the whistle on an Algeria visas scam had been singled out for revocation of his Maltese citizenship.\nReplying in parliament to remarks made on Tuesday by Jason Azzopardi, Julia Farrugia Portelli said the Nationalist MP had been very selective and misleading in his remarks.\nShe said that Alex Fezouine had not been singled out but was among a group of 17 against whom proceedings had been started.

We got no official communication of this [arrest] from our Italian counterparts,\u201d a police source said.\nMeanwhile, Maltese investigators involved in tracing down stolen vehicles said that dozens had been discovered on the island in the past five years. These were mainly from Italy and the UK.\nIllicit operations within the framework of the racket were believed to have slowed down after a series of crackdowns by the authorities, the sources said.\nThe Italian operation involved about 150 officers who searched 50 locations in several Italian cities. The two Maltese \u2018accomplices\u2019 were supposed to have been involved in liaising between the Italian car thieves and Libyan dealers who would sell the vehicles on order.\nThe Italian police last week released a recording of an intercepted phone call in which a man, who the sources identified as a Maltese national, and an Italian interlocutor discussed the collection of a BMW X5 arriving on the catamaran serving the Malta-Italy route.\nAccording to Italian police sources the two Maltese \u2018accomplices\u2019 were known to the authorities and were believed to have been involved in a number of criminal enterprises.\nThis included dismantling some of the luxury vehicles and selling them for parts on the Maltese black market. They were believed to have been involved in similar rackets in the past too, the sources said.\nYet, the Maltese police had yet to receive information about this from their Italian counterparts, Times of Malta was told.

It is made up of a number of elements including food, water, housing, education, health care, transport, clothing, as well as other essential needs, such as provision for unexpected events.\nHe referred to a research study carried out by Caritas three years ago which focused on low-income households and what basket of essential items these would require for a decent living. Taking such an approach, he said, would ensure that people were no longer pulled out of certain poverty bands only to get stuck in the \u201cat-risk-of-poverty\u201d classification.\n\u201cThis living income would allow a person to live a decent life. We\u2019re not saying people with low income will suddenly be able to afford to travel abroad once a month, of course not, but at least people would not be at risk of being pushed back into poverty at the first unexpected burden.\nWhen you live in a country constantly discussing \u2018L-aqwa \u017cmien\u2019 people struggle with admitting they cannot afford to heat their home\n\u201cThis should, of course, not be someone\u2019s final goal in life, but it should serve as a good push, backed by studies and efforts that are specifically catered for the person, so that one can move on further,\u201d Mr Borg explained.\nWhile the Alleanza Kontra l-Faqar is gearing up to start pushing for such a change with decision-makers, Mr Borg admitted that the group was aware of the hurdles it might face in the process, pointing to the Caritas study as an example.\n\u201cThat was a good study and it was discussed for some weeks but in reality it remained on the shelf gathering dust,\u201d Mr Borg said.\nA similar approach was rolled out on Wednesday in Italy amid widespread criticism. The Italian government\u2019s scheme, dubbed the citizens\u2019 income, will see those below the poverty line receiving a benefit that is paid via pre-paid debit cards and which can only be spent on food and medication. If there is money on the card at the end of the month, this is debited, rather than being carried over to the next month.\nThose benefiting from the scheme must also enrol in job training, with the scheme being lost if they turn down three job offers.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe Alleanza activist expressed a degree of scepticism on the figures published by the NSO last week. While there was nothing wrong with the methodology used by the NSO to calculate income and living conditions, there could be people reluctant to admit they are materially deprived.\n\u201cWhen you live in a country that is constantly discussing \u2018surplus\u2019 and \u2018L-aqwa \u017cmien\u2019 [\u2018the best of times\u2019 \u2013 Labour\u2019s 2017 election slogan] people struggle with admitting that they cannot afford to heat their home or to buy a second pair of shoes,\u201d Mr Borg said.\nThe figures were also two years old, meaning the current housing crisis affecting a good number of people might not have been reflected in the results, he noted. An increase of foreign workers and a booming economy should not be used as an argument to justify poverty, Mr Borg went on, expressing disappointment that the government had downplayed the increase of 0.7 per cent in the material deprivation rate.\nAccording to the NSO figures, 8.7 per cent of the people living in Malta last year were considered materially deprived while a further three per cent were severally materially deprived. This translated to a total of 55,000 people.\nThe number of people considered to be materially deprived increased for the first time since 2013, while those who were found to be suffering severe material deprivation decreased by 0.3 per cent.\nMaterial deprivation is defined as the inability to pay for unexpected expenses, afford a one-week annual holiday away from home, a meal involving meat, chicken or fish every second day, the adequate heating of a dwelling, durable goods such as a washing machine, a colour TV set, telephone or car, and being confronted with payment arrears.", "comment_count": 8, "id": 609}, {"keywords": "", "author": "Keith Micallef", "article_body": "Despite the various changes made to the controversial Rabat Road project plans, the Superintendence of Cultural Heritage has reiterated its concerns that such works might threaten archaeological remains and historic buildings.\nThis position was reaffirmed in the wake of the findings of the environmental impact assessment on the proposed development known as the central link project.\u00a0\nStretching from the foot of Saqqajja Hill on the outskirts of Rabat down to Mrie\u0127el Bypass, this \u20ac55 million project is meant to alleviate traffic congestion in Attard, notably Triq in-Nutar Zarb.
