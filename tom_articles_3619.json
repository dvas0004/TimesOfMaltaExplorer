He died in Malta two years later, aged 91 and his Irish wife, Margaret, decided to continue with the proceedings.\nThe case dates back to December 2012 when a woman \u2013 named in the Maltese proceedings as Diana Abdilla, then 54, but who is not identified by the Strasbourg Court, which refers to her as \u2018X\u2019 \u2013 claimed that Mr Mifsud was her biological father and asked the Civil Court (Family Section) in Malta to order that this be reflected on her birth certificate.\nThe Public Registry director requested the court to order the parties submit themselves to genetic tests. On the same day the director filed his application, Mr Mifsud denied he was the father and claimed that Ms Abdilla\u2019s mother had had various partners.\nMs Abdilla had also asked that both herself and Mr Mifsud should undergo genetic tests but he objected on various grounds including violation of his fundamental rights and also because any intervention could have negative medical implications given his advanced age.\nThe test was eventually held and the expert conducting it put the probability of paternity at 99.9998 per cent\nHowever, the court disagreed with him and he appealed.\u00a0\nThe Constitutional Court rejected the appeal and confirmed the first judgment arguing that Mr Mifsud would not have suffered any humiliation in having to undergo a buccal swab (collecting DNA from cells on the inside of the cheek), which was not an invasive action, and any turbulence that could be caused to his private and family life did not outweigh Ms Abdilla\u2019s interests.\nThe test was eventually held and the expert conducting it put the probability of paternity at 99.9998%.

However, in this case, the interference pursued a \u201clegitimate aim\u201d, that is, the protection of Ms Abdilla\u2019s rights and freedoms.\nIt agreed with the Constitutional Court that, respect for private life demanded that everybody should be able to establish details of one\u2019s identity as an individual human being. Furthermore, entitlement to such information was important because of its formative implications for one\u2019s personality, including obtaining the information required to uncover the truth on important aspects of one\u2019s personal identity, like knowing who one\u2019s parents were.\nThe Strasbourg-based Court described Mr Mifsud as being a British national. In fact, it notified the UK about the case but it did not intervene.\nFruit of extramarital affair\nDiana Abdilla was the fruit of an extramarital affair Frank Mifsud had with a woman who used to work for him, Margaret Felice, according to court evidence both in Malta and in Strasbourg.\nAccording to Ms Felice, she used to date Mr Mifsud in the late 1950s and at some point she got pregnant. She testified he wanted to interrupt the pregnancy and had seen a man who gave her an injection. She then miscarried.\nMr Mifsud had bought her a place in London where they used to meet since he was married. Ms Felice insisted she had always been faithful to him because she feared him, given he was a powerful man involved in criminal activities.\nShe conceived again from the relationship she had with Mr Mifsud and Ms Abdilla was born in January 1960.\u00a0\nHowever, the affair had eventually deteriorated, to the extent he also wanted her to prostitute herself.\u00a0\nMs Felice said she finally plucked up courage, left him and returned to Malta with her daughter.\nMs Abdilla recounted that, even when still young, she had always been told that Mr Mifsud was her father. Whenshe turned 16, she decided to write to him but he never answered.\u00a0\nThen, in 1978 she learned that Mr Mifsud would be visiting Malta and she went to meet him at the airport.\nIn her affidavit to the European Court of Human Rights, Ms Abdilla said he arrived with his family and noted a resemblance between herself and his daughter. However, she did not approach him though they did meet some time later in the presence of a lawyer.\nAccording to her, Mr Mifsud greeted her warmly and, subsequently, met on several occasions. She said she also met his wife. Ms Abdilla said her father told her he would not inform his children about her not to disrupt their schooling and she agreed.\nMr Mifsud used to visit Malta regularly on his own and when she became pregnant he offered her one of his properties where to stay, thus living together on his visits to the island.\u00a0\nMs Abdilla had a daughter in 1979 and Mr Mifsud was her godparent.\nShe said Mr Mifsud suggested she should move to London but returned 16 months later because she missed Malta and Mr Mifsud had allowed her to reside in a property he owned in Sliema. In 1998, Ms Abdilla said she was evicted from the property and then their relationship deteriorated.\u00a0\nDuring the eviction proceedings, he had promised her a sum of money to leave the premises peacefully, which she accepted but the money never arrived and the matter ended up in court, she said.", "comment_count": 7, "id": 2069}, {"keywords": "", "author": "", "article_body": "Former Opposition leader Simon Busuttil pledged on Tuesday he would keep knocking on the doors of justice after his bid for an inquiry into Konrad Mizzi and Keith Schembri was rejected by a magistrate.\nSimon Busuttil\nHe noted that, for the second time in just a few weeks, the courts had turned down a request for a magisterial investigation into the Tourism Minister and the Prime Minister\u2019s top aide in the wake of the Panama Papers revelations.\nThe Panama Papers had led to investigations, arrests, criminal procedures, resignations and even imprisonment across the globe but justice was not being served in Malta, Dr Busuttil said.\nPointing out he respected the court\u2019s decision, the former Nationalist Party leader said he was saddened that the country had no institution willing to investigate alleged corruption involving members of the government.\nDr Busuttil said he could either give up on the chance of justice ever being done or persist.

In fact, we are considering introducing a full body scanner in the future, which would check for arms, narcotics and cash,\u201d he said.\nMr Chetcuti took over the department three years ago after having worked his way up the ranks for three decades. When he took over, there were 200 operational staff. This has now gone up to nearly 400, with a 25 per cent increase at the airport which will be boosted by a further 15 per cent in the coming weeks, and a 10 per cent increase at the cargo ports, which may not be enough.\nThe increase may pale into in-significance compared to the 900 officers added in France and 700 in the Netherlands, but it is none-theless a considerable leap.\n\u201cThe Budget allocation was always based on a workforce of 400 but until now half of that money was returned.

If there is a deal, we will get the extra work but with no revenue.\u00a0\n\u201cAs we say in Maltese, we get the bone but with no meat on it,\u201d he said, pointing out that Malta only retains 20 per cent of the revenue as the rest goes to the European Commission.\nPassengers are just one aspect.

When all the consignments come from within the EU \u2013 including those that arrive via Italy \u2013 then the trailers would be released.\u00a0\nNow, if even one of them is from the UK, they will need to be processed at \u0126al-Far.\nThere are also 30 full loads a week via the sea ports, not to mention the 100 that come by airfreight, and 5,500 consignments a week that come by express mail and the as-yet unquantified amount that come via parcel post (although the majority are worth under \u20ac22 and would not fall under Customs scrutiny).\n\u201cWe would have to handle some 6,000 to 7,000 declarations a week more,\u201d Mr Chetcuti said.\u00a0\nAt the moment, although everything is in limbo, high-level meetings will be held in Brussels next week and the Customs Department is ready to roll out roadshows for the business community explaining things as they stand.\n\u201cFortunately, some 90 per cent of the business community already deals with third countries so they know what this entails.

it\u2019s who I am as a person, who I will be as a politician.\u201d\nThere\u2019s much else that is different about the 34-year-old Swede who is standing for the Democratic Party. She points out that her relocation to Malta eight years ago \u201cwas very natural\u201d and that Malta is a place \u201cwhere I felt at home as much as I felt at home in Sweden\u201d.\u00a0\nHer private and public personas are different in other ways too, so is her style of campaigning. She will not be posting out flyers, nor doing any home visits. \u201cMy campaign will be what I am,\u201d she says pointedly. \u201cI will do what I have been doing all along: organising clean-ups and being out there.\u201d\nMs Appelgren first came to Malta in 1999 to study English, and she became enamoured of the island and her host family \u2013 \u201can amazing family who became like a second family\u201d. Afterwards she took to visiting Malta every summer for several weeks.\n\u201cIn a way I see myself as having grown up in Malta,\u201d she elaborates. \u201cThen in Sweden I felt a bit stuck in the routines, and in dark winters, so I decided to take the leap and move to Malta before my children started school.\n\u201cAt the time I had a dream of being a diving instructor because I love the sea,\u201d she recounts. \u201cSo I took a trainee course and became an instructor, but that job only lasted for half a year because as a single parent I had to generate the salary of two persons, and that was not possible from diving.\u201d\nShe got into a corporate job \u2013 as a money-laundering reporting officer with a gaming company \u2013 and now she lives in a flat in Rabat with her two children, a girl of 11 and a boy of 13, as well as their Airedale terrier, a Yorkshire breed of terrier that\u2019s uncommon in Malta.\nMs Appelgren has become known for her regular cleanups around the Maltese Islands, something that she started in 2014. She coordinates the activities through a Facebook group \u2013 called Malta Clean Up \u2013 that boasts 7,300 members. She mounts a cleanup at least every month, which attracts between 10 and 70 participants, and she organises an annual national multi-site cleanup held in collaboration with local councils in which participants number between 1,000 to 2,000 people.\nAbortion is a question for the Maltese people, not for the EU to impose on Malta\n\u201cDuring the cleanups we educate people at the sites,\u201d Ms Appelgren says. \u201cWe report anything illegal we see \u2013 the group is not just about cleanup \u2013 this is more a holistic effort that I am leading.\u201d\nHer estimation is that the amount of litter around the country remains as prevalent as it was when she started out in 2014. \u201cBut the population has increased. And taking into account the increase in population, the litter per capita has decreased. That means things are getting better, and we need to keep on doing what we are doing.\u201d\nShe will maintain the momentum in her political campaign: maintain the tempo of cleanups, getting out there with her children and dog and mingling with people, delivering talks to companies on invitation about the environment and the green movement.\n\u201cI shall trust the people,\u201d she said. \u201cI trust my followers to spread the message.\u201d\nAt the same time, despite the non-politician imagery, in the few weeks since she has announced her candidacy Ms Appelgren has grown into the role. Her Facebook comments have become more measured and she has started to communicate to the media in rhetorical flourishes. She is setting herself up for success.\nYet her foreignness and womanhood has made her more susceptible to controversies. For example, an erstwhile comment on abortion has been dug out and made the rounds on social media last week, forcing her to spend a week reiterating that the personal choice she made \u2013 when she got pregnant at a relatively young age, and had her son \u2013 \u201cshould explain my personal view.\u201d\nAsked to elaborate, she says that her MEP platform is solely on the environment in a holistic manner, and abortion is an issue that is beyond the bounds of her MEP candidacy.\n\u201cI raised two children as a single mother, so my personal choice was clearly for motherhood,\u201d she says, adding that in any case she believes that abortion is \u201ca question for the Maltese people, not for the EU to impose it on Malta\u201d.\nShe has also been criticised for not speaking Maltese, impertinent criticism when considering that she is bidding for the European Parliament in Brussels, where Maltese proficiency would hold no advantage.\n\u201cMy children go to State schools,\u201d she points out, \u201cand I have been helping them with their Maltese homework. I know the basics, and can follow discussions in Maltese, but my time constraints as a single parent have not enabled me to pick up the language faster.

Equality for all went both ways, she added.\nIt was also an injustice to mothers because, with such a disparity, in the employers\u2019 eyes men will remain the ideal employees as they were not obliged to take on caring roles and, therefore, parental leave on the birth of a child.With the economy doing well, cannot the country afford to invest in the upcoming generation of workers, tax payers and social security contributors?\n\u201cTen days of paid birth leave is just the beginning, especially in a context of falling birth rates, which are below the replacement rate.\n\u201cWith the economy doing well, cannot the country afford to invest in the upcoming generation of workers, tax payers and social security contributors?\u201d she asked.\u00a0\nStudies clearly showed that the long-term benefits of paid paternity and parental leave outweighed the initial outlay cost and had a direct positive impact on the economy, the family and demographics, Dr Borg noted.\nIn comments to Times of Malta last week, the Chamber for Small and Medium Enterprises (GRTU) shot down the directive proposal and the Malta Employers\u2019 Association said it resisted any further financial burdens on employers.\nDr Borg said it should be up to the State to provide remuneration for paternity leave. In all probability, she added, if fathers had longer birth leave, mothers would go back to work earlier.\nAs things stood, it seemed that while women had shifted into the world of work, fathers had not made the move into the caring role at the same pace, meaning the changes added stress on mothers.\nWhile all harped on equality at an education level and securing a high rate of female graduates as a consequence, it had also to be made clear that caring roles should be shouldered jointly and that the matter should be facilitated by the State, Dr Borg remarked.\nApart from paternity leave, the new directive, for which Nationalist MEP David Casa was the European Parliament\u2019s rapporteur, will introduce new rights such as flexible working arrangements, four months parental leave, of which two months will be paid and are non-transferable, and a five-day carers\u2019 leave for those who need to look after relatives.\nA4E noted the positive step in ensuring that two of the four months parental leave granted would now be paid. This should encourage more fathers to share their parental leave with the mothers, especially if the levels of compensation were equal to one\u2019s own salary level.\n\u201cThese work-life balance measures are a step in the right direction for the much needed reforms to meet the emerging needs of modern families,\u201d the NGO said.\n\u201cIn Malta today, the majority of young mothers and fathers are in paid work and have to struggle daily to cope with the caring responsibilities of their children and the demands of work.\u201d\nA4E urged the government to move towards the swift transposition of the directive and expressed hope that payment levels would be high.\nForum Unions Maltin calls on government to discuss with social partners\nForum Unions Maltin welcomed the proposed EU work-life balance directive, saying it has supported the directive from its initial stages.\n\"The confederation believes that since this directive sets out the minimum entitlement, it is now up to Government to, in discussion with social partners, seek the implementation of the best model, which will see improved parental leave and measures supporting the family.\"\nU\u0126M welcomes directive\nThe U\u0126M Voice of the Workers also welcomed the directive.

However, bar one case, all appeared to be uninhabited.\u00a0\nWaste littered the site where the unsightly structures, which lacked any sanitary facilities, stood and the surrounding trees had evidently fallen victim to the \u2018shanty town\u2019 residents.\n\u201cThese tents were frequented over weekends by a number of Syrian families who would be especially visible at night due to bonfires next to their tents,\u201d a Ba\u0127ar i\u010b-\u010aag\u0127aq resident said.\u00a0\nAfter: the site after the tents were cleared.\nHe complained the place was fast becoming a no-go area\u00a0as people were becoming increasingly apprehensive of venturing there.\nThis newspaper enquired with the police, the Planning Authority and the Lands Authority on the matter. Though none them had replied at the time of writing, barely 24 hours after the questions were sent the Times of Malta was informed by passers-by that the tents had been removed.\nThe complete silence from the authorities meant it could not be established whether the tents has been removed on the strength of an enforcement action or otherwise. However, a closer inspection of the site showed the site had been left in a complete mess.\nRead: From informal camp site to dumping ground\nIn some places, concrete or gravel had been laid on virgin land to level the ground and, elsewhere, one could see rugs, old furniture and mattresses.\u00a0\nThere was also a metre-deep hole with a rusty metal tank immersed in it, posing a serious hazard to passers-by.\nThe removal of the tents was welcomed by at least one Ba\u0127ar i\u010b-\u010aag\u0127aq resident.\u00a0\n\u201cThe authorities have finally woken up because all our previous complaints seemed to have fallen on deaf ears,\u201d the man remarked when this newspaper visited the site over the weekend to confirm that it had indeed been cleared of the structures.\nHowever, he wondered who would be clearing up the mess left behind and if somebody would be prosecuted for the disfigurement of the place.", "comment_count": 26, "id": 2118}]
