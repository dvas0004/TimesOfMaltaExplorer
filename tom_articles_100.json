I am bipolar and suffer from lupus. Can you imagine how I feel without a roof over my head? I have been waiting for housing for 17 years.

These are extremely vulnerable people whose sole income is government benefits.\u201d\u00a0\nMr Bartolo said that while the proposed rent laws are a good start, it is not true that they will offer stability to the most vulnerable in Maltese society.\u00a0\nHe said landlords could easily evict their tenants after the minimum one-year rental period has expired.\u00a0\n\u201cIn reality, a year passes by very quickly,\u201d he said.", "comment_count": 0, "id": 3719}, {"keywords": "Media", "author": "", "article_body": "The following are the main stories in the newspapers on Thursday.\nTimes of Malta reports how petitioners who had called for a no-confidence vote in PN leader Adrian Delia have cried foul over how matters are being handled by the party.

It was unveiled on Monday by Matsec examinations board chairman Frank Ventura.\nMr Bartolo uploaded a post on his Facebook wall arguing that every language that one learnt opened new doors, and apart from learning Maltese and English, it was good to learn another language.\u00a0\n\nThe overwhelming reaction was that it was good to learn another language. But no one agreed that it should be made compulsory for sixth form students, as has been proposed.\u00a0\nThose arguing against the Matsec proposals included former MP Deborah Schembri, who is no stranger to opposing reforms by Mr Bartolo. Two decades ago, she led a student march when she was a University student and he was minister for the first time in the 1996 legislature. The issue then was over stipends.\n\"Sorry but as much as I love languages and would urge anyone to learn them I absolutely do not agree with imposing their study on students at sixth form level. Not knowing a language at intermediate or advanced level does not mean one cannot communicate in that language. Imposing the study of a third language at that level means:\n\"1. That if you happen to dislike languages you mess up your chances to get to university where you could wish to study something which does not require the use of the said third language at all;\n\"2. You also waste your time studying something you dislike instead of studying something that interests you, which is, in my view, akin to mortal sin,\" she wrote on Facebook.\n\nMoving the goalposts\nShe said that making it a requirement from 2020 onwards meant that students who had already started studying a third language without much success now had their goalposts changed mid-game as they were stuck with the study of that language for an additional two years. \"So much for legitimate expectations!\"\nWhilst the rest of the reform sought to bring out the best in students by taking note of their interests, this imposition went diametrically opposite that ethos and put student interests aside.\n\"We cannot treat 16-year-olds like adults giving them the right to vote on one hand and then treat them like 2-year-olds expecting to know better than them by dictating what they should direct their knowledge towards,\" she added.\n\"We are a country which has given its citizens innumerable civil liberties, we cannot take away the right to choose when it comes to the most fundamental aspect of growth... education\n\"Compulsory education stops at age 16 so it is ridiculous to make any subject compulsory from then on.

They are already under huge stress, what we need to do is ease the load rather than make it heavier.\" She also argued that the level of teaching of languages in secondary schools needed to improve. Many students who got a language pass at ordinary level could still not use that language effectively, she said.\u00a0\nBest time for new languages is in primary school\nDaniela Briffa said the best time for children to be introduced to foreign languages was in primary school.\nMelanie Meilak said not many students were good at languages and she feared many would drop out of sixth form. \"It would be better if courses on how to keep mentally healthy and how to handle stress are introduced,\" she said.\u00a0\n\"Moreover teaching them another language doesn't necessarily make students more able to communicate. I see everyday students that have full degrees but they don't have skills to communicate with others because they spent to much time on books and less integrating with one another.\"\nMarisa Deguaraga said MEPs could speak their native language in the European Parliament but this reform was telling Maltese students that Maltese, post, secondary was not as important as other languages.\nReplying, Mr Bartolo disagreed, saying the importance of Maltese was not being reduced. If anything, it was being increased through changes in Systems of Knowledge (which will have more emphasis on communication).\nBut another user, Dona Caruana, told the minister that if he wanted to give importance to Maltese, he needed to see why foreign pupils in primary were refusing to speak Maltese and the Maltese were therefore having to speak in English and lessons, she said, were held in English.\nDoors being closed\nJeffrey Camilleri said doors were being closed to students who were not so good in languages.\u00a0\nClaudia Agius also said the best time to learn a language was at primary school. Replying, Mr Bartolo said that in post-secondary, students would continue to learn a language which they would have started before. \"They will not be starting a new language,\" he wrote.\nClaudine Agius said that opportunity already existed in the current system.

The 275 reported domestic burglaries involved 445 victims \u2013 120 of whom were over 60.\n\u201cRoutine is the biggest problem when it comes to the elderly,\u201d Fabian Fleri remarks.\n\u201cWe\u2019re always telling them to break with routine. Think about it, all a thief needs to do is sit outside the church and notice the patterns of the elderly going to Mass every day, then follow one person home to know where s/he lives and strike the next day during Mass,\u201d he says, adding that elderly were often targeted in the beginning of the month when thieves knew they\u2019d find their pension at home \u2013 in cash.\nHe called on people to support their elderly relatives to make use of ATMs and internet banking or, at least, accompany them when they withdrew large sums of money. PIN numbers should never be kept near a debit or credit card.\nThe elderly should also be very careful when welcoming strangers \u2013 like deliverymen and workmen \u2013 into their homes.\n\u201cPrepare the money to pay the workman before he arrives so he doesn\u2019t hear you count money in another room. Always ask for identification and inform a relative if you are expecting a workman or delivery. If not, don\u2019t open the door,\u201d Mr Fleri warns, recalling a case when thieves passed themselves off as workmen from a telecommunications company.\n\u201cIn another case, thieves knocked at the house of an elderly woman at 1am and told her the parish priest wanted to speak to her. So be careful and stop and think. Always ask for documentation and if you don\u2019t have an intercom use the spyhole or look out the window,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe delivery person might not have bad intentions but he could say something over a beer with friends and you never know who\u2019s listening.

The block, adjacent to a construction site, collapsed when a worker cut through the bearing concrete surface of the building, killing them both. The recent building collapses have rekindled painful memories for Diane. This is her account:\n\u201cHearing about the recent buildings collapsing caused a lot of inner turmoil. It\u2019s taken me back to what happened to my mother. Amongst the feelings that reemerged there\u2019s anger: my mother is dead. No one can bring her back. Expecting that is unrealistic. But two people died and I had been hoping things would change.\nThese years have been difficult for us on so many levels. I think about that day every single day. The fact that my mother could not see my daughter, her only grandchild, grow up \u2013 that\u2019s very difficult. The fact that I can\u2019t call my mother when I need advice.\nPeople say time heals \u2013 it makes you stronger but also more sensitive. Sometimes I think: What if? What if she remained alive? What if this never happened? Why did it happen?\nMy daughter Miriana was two and a half at the time. That morning she was at my mother\u2019s house. I picked her up at 1.30pm after work. A couple of hours later, the building gave way.\nMiriana is now 17. Losing her nanna was very difficult. Unfortunately, she grew up around talk about accidents, precautions and court proceedings. So I think she grew up being very cautious.\nDiane (right) with her 17-year-old daughter Miriana, who was a toddler when her grandmother was killed\nNothing much has changed\n\u201cSo yes, these situations bring up all types of emotions. In the beginning, just after my mother\u2019s accident, and after the court decision, there was more awareness and people were being more careful. In 2009 the owner of the plot was convicted for three years and a construction worker sentenced to 18 months for the involuntary homicide of the two women. The case was appealed.\nBut things then started going back to how they were. These last few months, things just got worse. This is what I had been afraid of. Over the last few years every time I\u2019ve walked past a construction site I\u2019ve felt the need to stop and look. Unfortunately, it became part of me. It\u2019s a need I feel \u2013 to see if things have become any safer. The court had made several recommendations. They should have been implemented and enforced immediately after my mother\u2019s judgment for everyone\u2019s safety. What made me angry is that nothing much happened.\nMaria Dolores Zarb (left, inset) was giving a Maltese language lesson to Nadya Vavilova (right, inset) in her apartment when the building collapsed, killing them both.\nHopefully, with the new regulations, there will be change. But it\u2019s useless having things on paper \u2013 laws and regulations not being adhered to. We need enforcement. I can\u2019t have peace of mind knowing that laws are being ignored.\nI believe that it\u2019s not just the architect who should be responsible. It\u2019s the owner, the site manager, the builder, contractor and sub-contractor. Each and every role I mentioned must be clear and they should all be trained professionals in their own way. And by professionals I mean they have to be ethical and have a sense of moral values.\nStill waiting for appeal\n\u201cThe anger I have is because we are putting morality aside. I do understand that these are business people and they want to profit. But this should not come at the expense of protecting others \u2013 lives, property and possessions alike. Before these accidents there are sometimes warning signs that the residents would have flagged up. Let\u2019s listen to one another, especially in these circumstances. My heart goes out to the victims of the recent collapses. Thankfully, no one died but they suffered great losses. They lost their homes and their memories. Like us they were living a normal life then everything changed.\nWhen these things happen the government should immediately provide psychological support to all involved. Because it is very, very, very tough. Who knows how much these people have sacrificed to own a property \u2013 then suddenly you don\u2019t have anything. They don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen, where they\u2019ll live. They can\u2019t access their own belongings.\nThe government should also provide support for people to get back their possessions \u2013 not allow them to get buried under rubble or stolen. Even if they can retrieve a single photo or token \u2013 it would mean the world to them.\nMary Zarb, her brother, Fr Elias Vella, her daughter Diane, and grand-daughter Miriana\nVictims should be given a point of contact to access during nearby construction and afterwards in case of such tragedies. They need to know their rights, where to seek professional help \u2013 whether it\u2019s legal or architectural. I think we\u2019re lacking over there.\nWe\u2019re still waiting for the appeal to be decided. But the outcome of the appeal is not really relevant for me. What I always wanted is that whoever was involved becomes more responsible. And peace of mind. I would not want anyone to have to go through this. It\u2019s something which marks you for life.\nOver the last few years every time I\u2019ve walked past a construction site I\u2019ve felt the need to stop and look. Unfortunately, it became part of me. It\u2019s a need I feel \u2013 to see if things have become any safer.- Marie Diane Mule Stagno\nI want to make people understand that being responsible is of the utmost importance. Residents need to be responsible by avoiding a laissez-faire attitude and seeking guidance and support. The relevant authorities need to take these matters seriously without fear or favour.\nThose in the industry need to be responsible for other people\u2019s lives. Yes, business is important. But not to the detriment of others. I can\u2019t accept that.\u201d\nSupport for victims?\nVictims of construction-related accidents have been calling for more support when such tragedies occur. Some people who lost their homes during the three recent incidents even suggested having a point of contact to guide them on the way forward and inform them about their rights.\u00a0\nThey spoke about the need for psychological support and for a system in place to safeguard their belongings from being buried or stolen from the rubble.\nTimes of Malta asked the Infrastructure Ministry if there were plans to introduce any such measures.

Maltese contractors F.

The most important of these is the ability to adopt a balanced perspective of the reality the party is experiencing. Healing demands a strong dose of goodwill, of fraternal reciprocal respect, a flexibility to consider moving to other points from which to view different assessments, judgements, potential solutions and changes. Bringing the people involved together in a different ambiance ought to be therapeutic in itself. My job is to facilitate this process.\nYour final report is due to be presented within a year. Will the party have enough time to implement the proposals effectively until the next general election?\nI will not be spending my time writing reports.

The idea is to realise marked progress within 12 months. There is no guarantee we will succeed but in the meantime, I will give it my all.\nHow are the challenges faced by the party today different than the challenges faced by the party when you were general secretary?\nOn two levels. Today we are dealing with a completely different society and a different Labour Party. When the PN was then in government (1987-1996; 1998-2013) we empowered society to liberate itself and take its rightful place in Europe. This changed society rapidly and dramatically, generally for the better. The Labour Party itself under Joseph Muscat changed radically. These confront the PN with a reality which needs to be recognised.\nHow will you ensure the party will remain relevant to voters?\nA party which receives the support of 37 per cent of the electorate cannot but by definition be a most relevant party in any country. Thousands of young modern voters voted for us and are active in the party. But we need to do much more and to rethink our political stance on a variety of issues that are close to the culture and mentality of today\u2019s society, especially the younger generation to ensure we can speak credibly and with authority on issues that impact the common good and future generations.\nRELATED STORIESOpinion - The many ironies of Louis Galea's appointmentPN veteran Louis Galea set to lead party reform process\nThere is no sense in belonging to a broad political church which allows a rainbow of opinions and ideas to coexist and then one refuses to compromise to achieve agreement on a set of common goals essential for the progress, peace and prosperity of a nation.\nIs the internal fighting within the PN caused by different personalities or different ideologies?
