These nominees disguised the true ownership of Hearnville, Tillgate and Egrant.\nWhy is this suspicious?\nCorporate service providers usually incorporate companies upon request by a client.\nThis raises the question as to why Nexia BT would go through the expense of maintaining these companies, on the off-chance that a client or clients would walk into their San \u0120wann office asking for three Panama shell companies that were set up in a way that disguises their ownership.\u00a0\nA leaked FIAU report questioned if the Panama companies were owned by Mr Schembri and Dr Mizzi from the start. Both men deny this.\nMr Cini\u2019s enquiries about setting up a Panama company and a trust started in March 2013, a few days after Labour swept to power in the general election.\nIn August 2013, the shell companies were transferred into the custody of Brian Tonna, Nexia BT\u2019s managing partner and a good friend of the Prime Minister\u2019s chief of staff, Mr Schembri. Evidence to this effect can be found in the Panama Papers.\nTwo months later, a consortium of Maltese businessmen along with Azerbaijan\u2019s State energy company Socar and German company Siemens were announced as the preferred bidders for the power station project.\nThis deal gave the Electrogas consortium a guaranteed revenue stream worth \u20ac3.9 billion over a 19-year period.\nMr Tonna headed one of the selection committees that awarded Electrogas the contract.\n\nBanking on secrecy\nDuring the run-up to Christmas 2014, Nexia BT are told what documents they need to set up a New Zealand trust for their as yet unnamed clients.\nFive months later, Karl Cini asks Mossack Fonseca if they can forgo the two bank reference letter for their \u201cclients\u201d, who he says would like to avoid informing their banks about what they were doing.\nLater correspondence and documents in the Panama Papers proves these two clients were Mr Schembri and Dr Mizzi.\nAt least eight attempts to open bank accounts for the government officials can be found in the Panama Papers.\nMossack Fonseca\u2019s attempts to open up these accounts for Nexia BT\u2019s client were often frustrated by the fact that the banks were reluctant to deal with politically exposed persons owning shell companies, due to the increased corruption and money-laundering risk.\nWhy is this suspicious?\nDocuments in the Panama Papers indicate Mr Schembri and Dr Mizzi were planning on receiving monthly payments of \u20ac150,000 into their Panama companies.\nIf the planned injection of funds was going to originate from their pre-existing wealth, as the two men claim, their local banks would have nonetheless noticed any monetary transfers from their local accounts to Tillgate and Hearnville.\nThe apparent reluctance to even risk informing local banks about what they were doing shows the lengths to which the two government officials went through to disguise their activities.\nNexia BT also failed to inform the local tax authorities about the trust structures they set up for Dr Mizzi and Mr Schembri.\nHow is money laundering carried out?\nMoney laundering is typically carried out in three stages: Placement, layering and integration.\nAt placement stage, the money launderer aims to introduce his ill-gotten gains into the financial system. Shell companies and trusts are one of the favoured vehicles for doing this, as they disguise the owners of those funds.\nEvidence of Mr Schembri\u2019s and Dr Mizzi\u2019s desire to disguise their link to any funds generated by their offshore vehicles exists in the Panama Papers, as already shown above.\nLayering\nNext up comes the layering, where the money launderer seeks to hide the origins of the funds and make tracing transactions difficult.\nJurisdictions like Panama are known to be favourite countries for money-laundering activities.\nEvidence of this layering technique can be found in the Panama Papers, as documentation shows ownership of the Panama companies was transferred to the New Zealand trusts.\nNexia BT told Mossack Fonseca most of these funds would remain in the same bank account unless transferred up into the New Zealand trust in the form of dividends.\nMr Schembri and Dr Mizzi were in the process of opening bank accounts in the Bahamas for the Panama companies, adding another layer in the form of an additional jurisdiction where funds would have moved through.\nFor the trust set up by Dr Mizzi, his wife and children were named as the beneficiaries of any funds flowing into it from the Panama company.\nThis is typical of a trust set-up, where the settlors transfer assets for the benefit of a third-party, divesting them from the person putting in the funds.\nDr Mizzi\u2019s trust was revocable, meaning the minister could terminate the trust and take back the assets at any time.\nThe trust set up by Mr Schembri has been viewed with more suspicion, as he was both the person settling the funds into it, as well as the beneficiary of those same funds.\nIntegration\nA money launderer\u2019s final task is extracting his ill-gotten gains so it can be used without attracting the attention of law enforcement officials or the tax authorities.\nNo evidence of this stage of the process exists in the Panama Papers, as Dr Mizzi and Mr Schembri\u2019s attempts to open up bank accounts halted as soon as assassinated journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia published her first stories about the scheme.\n\nWhy are we still writing about this?\nThe FIAU first asked the police to investigate potential evidence of criminal action in the Panama Papers in April 2016.\nSince then, little known action has been taken by the police to mount a serious investigation into Mr Schembri (right) and Dr Mizzi\u2019s actions and intentions. They are not known to have ever been called in for questioning about their activities.\nThe German federal police passed on Panama Papers documents to the Maltese authorities towards the end of 2017.\nPrime Minister Joseph Muscat has spent the past three years sheltering the two men from calls to resign. He has also refused to sack them.\nJust last month, Dr Muscat said he saw no reason to question Mr Schembri\u2019s business plans with 17 Black.\njacob.borg@timesofmalta.com", "comment_count": 59, "id": 954}, {"keywords": "", "author": "Ivan Camilleri", "article_body": "Tension is brewing at the Presidential Palace over an unprecedented arrangement made between Prime Minister Joseph Muscat and former Presi\u00addent Marie Louise Coleiro-Preca that allows her to retain certain functions of her former office, The Sunday Times of Malta is informed.\nThe new State-funded \u2018Office of the President Emeritus\u2019 permits Dr Coleiro-Preca to carry on with her charity work, which is completely unremunerated, according to her spokesman.\nThe former president has also retained the administration of two entities \u2013 The Presi\u00addent\u2019s Trust and The President\u2019s Foundation for the Wellbeing of Society \u2013 which she had set up during her time as President.\nThe spokesman said the foundations\u2019 statutes have now been changed to reflect the new set-up.

Many questioned the need for such a mechanism when Liquigas (a joint venture between Liquigas S.p.A. of Italy and Multigas Ltd of Malta) which bottles and distributes LPG, makes door-to-door deliveries free of charge. The service is offered over the phone, through the company\u2019s website and even on Facebook.\nIndustry sources had said at the time that the agreement smacked of State aid through the back door, an attempt to avoid landing in hot water with Brussels.\u00a0\nDetails on the subsidies paid so far were only granted to The Sunday Times of Malta following a Freedom of Information request, after the Energy Ministry failed to reply to questions.\nBetween May 2014 and May 2018, a total of \u20ac2,040,942 were paid out in subsidies, with the annual amount increasing each year. It totalled \u20ac271,089 in the first year, more than doubling to reach \u20ac572,535 in the next, while between June 2016 to May 2017 it rose further to \u20ac614,358. Then, in the period June 2017 to May last year, taxpayers ended up forking out \u20ac854,049, more than three times as much as the subsidy paid in the first year.\nConsequently, the average compensation per vendor also registered an increase, from \u20ac11,295 in the first year up to \u20ac30,502 in the fourth. During this period the highest subsidy given to an individual door-to-door seller shot up from \u20ac39,646 to \u20ac81,844 last year.\nHowever, not all of the 31 licenced vendors benefitted, with the number of those receiving compensation ranging between 24 and 28. For some reason, not all of those entitled to it filed a compensation claim.\u00a0\nNonetheless, the initial warning of some in the industry has been confirmed: as more players entered the gas distribution market, the level of compensation claims would rise. This is because with the presence of more licenced vendors and more fixed-sale points, these select group of door-to-door distributors are more likely to suffer a drop in sales.\nState Aid is forbidden under EU rules except if a particular sector is declared to be of \u201cgeneral economic interest\u201d. In the case of gas vendors, the government had justified the compensation on the basis that it wanted to guarantee the gas distribution service to remote areas deemed not to be commercially viable.\nThis concession came into force after the competition watchdog in 2013 had declared null an exclusivity agreement that went back to 1992. This ruling had paved the way for the liberalisation of the gas distribution sector. However, door-to-door vendors who were granted a licence after the 2014 PSO agreement are not eligible to subsidies.\u00a0", "comment_count": 23, "id": 962}, {"keywords": "Education", "author": "", "article_body": "Junior Achievement Young Enterprise Malta Foundation (JAYE) concluded its 30th anniversary celebrations with its Annual Finals and Awards Night a few days ago. Recently-appointed CEO Fiona Captur revisits the events of the year, while looking ahead to new opportunities.\nIt has been an incredible year for the Junior Achievement Young Enterprise Malta Foundation (JAYE). For its 30th anniversary celebrations, the organisation held the Junior Achievement European Annual Conference in Malta last December, including an Entrepreneurship Education Summit. This was followed by a 30th Anniversary Gala Dinner, bringing together past and current CEOs, mentors, teachers, staff, alumni, students, sponsors and JAYE friends.\n\u201cIt was an opportunity to meet all the people touched by JAYE and to see the JAYE influence feeding down the generations,\u201d said new CEO Fiona Captur.\n\u201cHaving taken a good look behind us at all our achievements, the baton has now been handed over to me to take JAYE into its next phase of growth.\u201d\nJAYE offers extraordinary experiences to people of different ages. At primary level, the organisation works on building students\u2019 awareness of the part they ought to play in their community and society as a whole. At secondary level, the foundation promotes a more European concept of economics. There is also strong focus on the importance of continued education and the correlation between education and the working world.\nThe Company Programme at sixth form and the StartUp Programme at tertiary level are the basis of the \u2013 by now familiar \u2013 annual competition.\n\u201cThe competition is but a means to an end,\u201d she continued. \u201cThe JAYE experience gives our students more than business plans and financial statements. Our achievers take away life skills they didn\u2019t know they had; skills that employers today are desperately looking for. Initiative, communication, teamwork, negotiation skills and perseverance complement the business and financial acumen they learn, making them more work-ready.\u201d\nThe 2019 Company Programme winners announced at the Awards were Code B, from GF Abela Junior College, who were named Company of the Year. YGM from St Edward\u2019s College won the Best Presented Financial Statements Award, while the Best Business Plan Award and Best Digital Marketing Awards went to Exhale, from St Aloysius College. Enlight, also from St Aloysius College, won the Best Human Resources Award, while the EFQ Quality in Excellence Award was won by AIDA from GF Abela Junior College. Rel8 from St Aloysius College was named Best Social Enterprise.\nThe StartUp of the Year 2019 Award was won by JAXI, from St Martin\u2019s Institute. Other StartUp winners were IntolerEat from the University of Malta, which was awarded the Best Social Enterprise Award, and Rizerve from St Martin\u2019s Institute won the Best Business Potential Award. Finally, Elaine Busuttil Gili from St Edward\u2019s College won the John Harper Award, and the Philip Bonnet Award for Perseverance was awarded to Andrew Emanuel Attard, from the University of Malta.\n\u201cWe were awed and humbled to have been selected as finalists,\u201d said the students behind Code B. \u201cSo, when we won JAYE Malta Company of the Year Award, we could not\nhave been happier. What started as a simple idea eventually came to fruition as BIN IT, a product that is now used by hundreds of households in Malta and Gozo. This experience has been like no other, and one that taught us new skills that we could not have learnt academically in a class.\u201d\nJAXI\u2019S team members were equally enthusiastic. \u201cThe announcement provided a moment of true happiness. We couldn't believe we had really made it, together, as a team. We worked hard to achieve this. We received a lot of valuable advice from our mentors and judges, and are very appreciative of it.\n\u201cWinning did not come easy,\u201d they added. \u201cIt required diligence, energy and long hours. Yet we believe that we can now apply the new skills we learned to the real business world.\u201d\n\u201cThe critical point is that while we have winning teams, the individual experience for each achiever makes them all winners. Managing disappointment and learning from it is equally part of that journey,\u201d emphasized Captur. \u201cThe winners now head for the JA European Finals where standards are very high so while excited, they really need to up their game!\u201d\nTaking a walk down memory lane, Captur recalled being actively involved in the setup of the then-Young Enterprise 30 years ago.\n\u201cWe had one desk phone and one floppy disk on a shared PC. No e-mail or mobiles \u2013 nothing. What certainly hasn\u2019t changed is the passion that inhabits all those involved with JAYE. On the other hand, the products the students come up with reflect an interesting evolution \u2013 going from clocks and cork mats in the 1980s to apps and technology now.\u201d\nLooking ahead, Captur affirmed that entrepreneurship education is critical in a constantly-evolving world, and needs its place in the school curriculum. To this end, JAYE will be participating in the JA European Entrepreneurship Education Summit in Lille, France, this July. It will bring together European governments, businesses, NGOs, researchers and educators, and its mission is to increase the quantity, quality and impact of entrepreneurship education in Europe.\n\u201cStudents need to keep evolving in a world where we do not understand what tomorrow\u2019s jobs will require,\u201d she added. \u201cIn this competitive world we live in, the skills JAYE imparts are critical.\u201d\nJAXI \u2013 StartUp of the Year Winners \u2013 St Martin\u2019s Institute", "comment_count": 0, "id": 963}, {"keywords": "", "author": "", "article_body": "The following are the top stories in Malta's newspapers on Sunday.\u00a0\nThe Sunday Times of Malta reports that\u00a0tension is brewing at the Presidential Palace over an unprecedented arrangement made between Prime Minister Joseph Muscat and former Presi\u00addent Marie Louise Coleiro-Preca that allows her to retain certain functions of her former office.\nThe newspaper also reports that\u00a0the number of traffic tickets issued by the police in 2018 dropped to a six-year low, with an average of 4,400 fines issued every month.\nThe Malta Independent on Sunday says climate change and migration are having an impact on infectious disease levels in Malta.\nMalta Today reports about possible dangers from a Huawei communications ling.

AI has been with us for some time through existing technology, sometimes unknowingly, but other times very evidently.\nIt would be na\u00efve to say we did not know that this was coming. In the past 15 years, Amazon, Google and others leveraged the use of machine learning to their commercial advantage using natural language processing on voluminous data to understand consumer behaviour and embedded use in their online services.\nNowadays, robotic devices work alongside humans in manufacturing and services. Driverless cars are being tested as we speak, and smart algorithms are working in the background to offer suggestions to internet users for products and services through the use of vast consumer data being captured.\nThe European Union\u2019s ambition is \u201cto become the world-leading region for developing and deploying cutting-edge, ethical and secure AI, promoting a human-centric approach in the global context\u201d. To this end, a coordinated plan on AI has been drawn up to maximise the impact of investments at EU and national levels, encourage synergies and cooperation across the EU, have a common approach on ethics, foster the exchange of best practices and collectively define the way forward.\nIt is therefore important that the European Commission keeps a close watch on Member States\u2019 developments on AI. Terming this \u2018AI Watch\u2019 and led by the Commission, this initiative will provide strategic guidance for national strategies in a coordinated European fashion.\nThe foreseen AI Watch tasks include:\n\u2022 the development of an AI ecosystem;\n\u2022 the benchmarking of capabilities and performance of AI-based systems;\n\u2022 the monitoring in the uptake of AI applications across the economy;\n\u2022 the development of a precise estimate on the evolution of the European market shares in robotics;\n\u2022 to monitor the impact on the workforce;\n\u2022 the gathering of information on Member States\u2019 national initiatives on AI;\n\u2022 the analysis on the use and impact of AI in public services;\n\u2022 the development of a set of structured AI indicators, and\n\u2022 the setting up of an online portal for the dissemination of all the information for timely use by Member States.\nAdditionally, the EU has proposed the setting up of national or regional innovation hubs to build up national capabilities in AI and share information. To complement national investments by the Member States, these hubs will be instrumental to acquire EU funding on AI. Various workgroup meetings, led by the Commission, have already started between the Commission and the Member States. The eSkills Malta Foundation is one of the Malta representatives.\nOn the local scene, yet again, Malta\u2019s commitment into the digital world of AI was already shown by setting up the \u2018Malta.AI\u2019, which launched a high-level policy document for public consultation in March 2019. The main areas of focus include investment, start-ups, and innovation, public and private sector adoption, education and workforce, legal and ethical frameworks, and the AI ecosystem infrastructure.\nMalta.AI has set up various national workgroups to come up with feedback on these areas which will eventually feed into a national AI strategy. The EU is very conscious of this effort and is following our work closely. Only a few countries have really tackled the launch of an AI strategy, and yet again Malta will be in the leading pack.\nThe national AI strategy will be in sync with other existing strategies and initiatives, such as the national eSkills strategy and Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) regulation. It is also a fact that the national ICT industry has started transforming their products for AI, and some firms are also working hard to launch products.\nAI introduces opportunities in almost all areas, including healthcare, mobility, fintech, advanced manufacturing, smart power systems, bio-economy, media and crime detection. In the past, we have been speaking about the subject of digital transformation and this is part of it.
