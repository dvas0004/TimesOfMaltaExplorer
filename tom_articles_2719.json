The AG had said that the inquiry found that there was no evidence that the prime minister or his wife owned the secret Panama company known as Egrant.\nOpposition leader Adrian Delia has since been calling for the full report to be published.\u00a0\nIn final submissions on Monday before the constitutional court,\u00a0Dr Vincent Galea, representing Dr Delia, objected to a claim made by the Attorney General in written submissions that while NGOs and\u00a0 investigative journalists may have a right for such information for their investigations, EU jurisprudence never made a mention of such a right for the\u00a0 leader of the opposition.\nEU jurisprudence only mentioned journalists and NGOs because there never was a case anywhere where this type of information was not handed to the leader of the opposition, Dr Galea said.\nAnd didn't the Opposition leader also have a right to inform the public?\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\nHe argued that the AG's refusal to hand a copy of the report to the leader of the opposition meant that the prime minister had an advantage over other persons in the political arena. Indeed, copies had been handed to lawyer Pawlu Lia, the Justice Minister and Kurt Farriugia, who was the prime minister's spokesman, although these were not mentioned in the AG's written submissions.\nWas there anything to hide?\u00a0\nFurthermore,\u00a0 throughout the hearing of the case there had been strong opposition to the summoning of certain witnesses.\nREAD: Failure to publish Egrant report means people cannot be held to account - lawyer\nWhen the Police Commissioner was summoned to testify, certain questions had not been allowed. The witness had made reference to \u2018ongoing investigations.\u2019\nWhen were these to be concluded? Was the country to remain in this state of uncertainty?.\nDr Galea stressed that it was for the Attorney General to prove that his refusal to hand over a copy of the report had been justified.\nThe AG could at least have been granted Dr Delia permission to see the report at the AG\u2019s Office, a right sometimes afforded to journalists. But not even a redacted copy had been offered. In this case there was an outright refusal, Dr Galea stressed.\u00a0\nBut since the document had effectively been published, the Opposition Leader had a constitutional a right to a copy so as to inform the public.\u201cWas the AG's decision to refuse a copy proportional to the breach of the Opposition leader's right for such information?\nDr Galea urged Mr Justice Robert Mangion, to obtain copy of the report and take it into account before delivering judgment, thus being in a better position to assess whether the AG\u2019s refusal was proportional to the alleged breach of the opposition leader's rights.\nMoreover, if the conclusions exonerated the PM\u2019s wife, \u201cwhy not publish the relative facts contained in the first part of the report? It would have added weight to the conclusions\u201d, Dr Galea argued.\nIn his reaction, the Attorney General said this had been an administrative decision that was subject to judicial review and Dr Delia therefore ought have resorted to the ordinary courts rather than seek a constitutional remedy.\nHe pointed out that it had stated, in a press conference, that a copy of the report had been given to the prime minister.\nAlthough the Egrant inquiry had been requested by the prime minister in his personal capacity, it had acquired a constitutional status since the PM\u2019s office had been involved in its outcome.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cHence one needs to distinguish between the PM and others who just want a copy of the report for sake of political debate,\u201d Dr Grech went on.\nAs to whether a redaction of the report should have been made available, he argued that this would have immediately prompted speculation as to the parts blocked out.

The latter\u2019s father later allegedly showed up at the school accompanied by two other men.\nTwo staff members, understood to be an assistant head and a teacher, were hurt as they tried to break up the fight.\nThe brawl was followed by another incident a few days later, where a student and a school official\u00a0got into a fight at the St Ignatius College secondary school in Qormi.\nTeachers\u2019 representatives have subsequently complained that such incidents were becoming increasingly common in many of Malta\u2019s schools and action needed to be taken to ensure schools were safe.\nMajor John Schembri, who is conducting the review of the schools \u2013 including those of Pembroke and Qormi \u2013 told the Times of Malta that one of the major shortcomings was the way cars piled in front of schools at drop off and pick up times. In some schools, this was coupled with no clear entry and exit pathways, as well as a mess of multiple entrances to the school grounds.\n\u201cDropping off or picking up children from school needs to be structured. It cannot just be something you do at the last minute in a disorganised way, but more like when you go to the airport to catch a flight,\u201d he said.\u00a0\nIn some cases, issues of doors being left unlocked had been also been uncovered, but Mr Schembri insisted that this was not a widespread issue.\nOnce completed in the next few weeks, the audit will help the education authorities devise a national school security policy.\nThis, Mr Schembri said, would have to work throughout Malta\u2019s diverse schooling set-up.\nMany of the island\u2019s schools, he said, were different and posed unique challenges.\u00a0\n\u201cTake the Pembroke school for instance, that was originally built as a hospital and so has a particular lay out. We may have to have individual plans for specific schools coupled with guidelines for the whole schooling system,\u201d he said.\nAn Education Ministry spokesman said the government would be looking into the possibility of new security systems, including camera networks at schools after the audit was completed.\nMr Schembri said that in the absence of previous reviews, the security audit had first started with the setting of a minimum standard to establish a baseline against which the schools were assessed.\u00a0\n'Room for improvement'\nSo how did schools do? Mr Schembri said there was \u201croom for improvement\u201d, but he had not come across any major issues that could not be overcome with \u201cinvestment and the right attitude\u201d.\n\u201cMost of the security issues we\u2019ve encountered can be dealt with through the introduction of \u2018soft measures\u2019, like having a policy that promotes safer behaviour. This, coupled with a few hard infrastructural amendments, will address the situation,\u201d he said.\nThe solutions, he added, would have to be sustainable and cost effective. At this point the ministry spokesman was quick to point out that the budget allocation for school security had been beefed up to around \u20ac280,000 this year.\n\u00a0Schools in Malta have protocol for security, for instance for when parents visit the premises for a meeting with teaching staff.\u00a0\nNeed for a behavioural shift\nIn some cases, Mr Schembri said, amendments to these protocols were now being drafted.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t expect schools to be a fortress environment. But there has to be a behavioural shift towards respect and safety,\u201d he said.\nThe ministry spokesman said a lot of unruly behaviour by students could be pinned down to youths not engaging with the educational experience.\u00a0\nMeanwhile, the Malta Union of Teachers have presented their own proposals for improved security in schools. The union said its officials had held a meeting with the Education Minister and presented nine proposals.\nThese included a review of the physical access to schools to ensure there was only controlled access.\nOther measures it proposed included the allocation of a fund for security in schools and the deployment of security personnel, a revision of the allocation of Prefects of Discipline with an increase in personnel and a ban on mobile phones in schools and its respective enforcement.\nMUT welcomes initial report\nThe Malta Union of Teachers said it welcomed the initial findings of the report and looked forward to more details on the way forward together with the immediate implementation of measures, particularly those identified as most crucial, for the improvement of security in schools\nIt said it had already held two meetings with the Audit team and shall be following the outcome.\nThe Nationalist Party in a statement said the issue of security at schools needed to be taken seriously by the government immediately.\nIt said a lack of commitment by the government was demotivating teachers.\u00a0\u00a0", "comment_count": 6, "id": 2123}, {"keywords": "", "author": "Jacob

continued to give weight to a 2007 outline permit to build a 120sqm villa, while selectively applying a provision in the 2014 rural policy and design guidance allowing the businessman to extend this development to 200sqm.\nIn the court ruling, the judge upheld arguments by a third-party objector stating that the tribunal could not simply cherry-pick parts of the rural policy that favoured Mr Gasan.\nThe application had to be decided exclusively on all provisions contained in the policy, the court said.\nTribunal could not simply cherry pick rural policy\nMr Gasan\u2019s permit had been rejected by the Planning Authority for not being in conformity with this policy.\nThe court ordered a revocation of the tribunal\u2019s decision, and ordered the same tribunal to decide on Mr Gasan\u2019s application solely on the basis of the 2014 policy.\nA previous refusal by the Planning Authority was overturned by the EPRT in October 2013 on the grounds that demolition of the illegal farm should be considered a planning gain as the illegal farm was causing an \u201cadverse visual impact\u201d.\nPrior to the December decision by the tribunal, Mr Gasan filed an application for full development of the site in 2015 but the Planning Authority rejected it.\nIt concluded that the application for two villas, including swimming pools and semi-basement levels for a games room, gyms, offices, stores and parking areas, went far beyond the one-floor unit envisioned in the outline permit and would breach numerous policies.\nAccording to the case officer\u2019s report on the application, the Environment Protection Directorate expressed concerns that the villas would \u201cobliterate\u201d existing rural features and intensify urban use within the countryside.\nThe directorate had also expressed concerns about possible further future pressure for any other ancillary interventions and further similar developments in the countryside that would lead to a cumulative

The condition is likely the result of inbreeding, a common problem in Malta, with Xitan\u2019s mother having been mated with her own biological father.\n\u201cThe condition means that his stifle is somewhat deformed, and thus his legs are misshapen. His back is fine, but horses with stifle problems cannot be used for riding as they could easily fall and injure both themselves and the rider,\u201d Ms Curmi explained.\nFalling in love with Xitan is an easy enough matter, as the horse appears to be extremely friendly and affectionate, even with strangers.\nWhat this means, in essence, is that anyone willing to rehome Xitan needs to be in a position to keep him purely as pet. Ideally, the young woman adds, the horse is kept somewhere where he can get plenty of exercise as otherwise the joints tend to stiffen up very fast.\n\u201cIf this is not possible, a stable will also be fine as long as the new owner is willing to give Xitan plenty of exercise,\u201d she adds.\nWith Malta\u2019s handful of horse rescue shelters full to the brim and Xitan\u2019s particular requirements, finding an alternative home for the beautiful beast is turning out to be more difficult than anticipated, but Ms Curmi has not yet lost hope of finding a suitable home before she has to do the unthinkable.\n\u201cIt breaks my heart to think of having to put him down. I have been going crazy contacting everyone I know and explaining the situation, but so far no-one has worked out.

Meanwhile, people have money in their pockets and are not interested in what is happening at the top.\u201d\nAs for the future: \u201cSadly, I don\u2019t think we are going to leave any heritage and legacy that is in any way equivalent to that left by our forefathers.\u201d\nWithout much nostalgia and emotion, Prof. England harks back to the youth in the 1960s, saying it was the first time people forgot World War II and the future looked so positive. \u201cI remember Malta as a virgin\u2026 which implies that it is now a whore.\u201d\nWhen the idea to write an autobiography was floated by family members, who joked about him doing it before dementia set in, he rejected it, saying it would be nothing but \u2018autofiction\u2019 \u2013 a means to \u201cflex my muscles and say that if it were not for me, the world would have been a worse place\u201d.\nBut he is not out to boost his ego. \u201cArchitects need more eco than ego\u201d, he says later on.\n\nThe end result contains the 81-year-old\u2019s memories about what influenced him, his mentors, the places he visited, the books he read, those who passed away, which are becoming more frequent, as well as humorous anecdotes to \u201cpepper it up\u201d.\nGiving credit to his great masters, who taught him the intellectual and philosophical side to architecture, he says a building can either make you happy or ruin your life.\nQuoting blind Argentinian author Jorge Luis Borges, Prof. England says that when asked why he travelled, the writer replied: \u201cIt is more important to feel a place than to see it.\u201d\nIt is also more important how a building influences us than how it looks, Prof. England continues, though both concepts seem to be alien today. And his belief that architecture should enhance the spirit and uplift the soul is even more outlandish.\nI remember Malta as a virgin\u2026 which implies that it is now a whore\nArchitecture is about commodity, firmness and delight, he explains, quoting Roman architect Vitruvius. But if the focus is on the first two qualities only, they merely add up to construction \u2013 what Malta is \u201clittered\u201d with.\nRecently asked to talk about the state of architecture on the island, he corrected the question, saying it was the state of the \u201cbuilding industry\u201d.\nAgainst the concentration of high-rise buildings in one area, he highlighted the problems of infrastructure and traffic that inevitably arose around them. Referring to Sliema, he said the towers in the area would mean thousands more occupants, and therefore, thousands more cars on the streets, which could not be widened \u2013 even though that was not the solution to the traffic problem anyway.\n\u201cThe problem is not the parking spaces but getting these cars to move into and out of the underground car parks altogether at around the same time,\u201d he pointed out, adding that it would also be impossible to cope with a fire.\nThen there was the issue of building a tower in the same way that you do a five-storey building and adding floors to it. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t work that way!\u201d\nWhile he was not against development and the need to go high, Prof. England has been harping on the fact that it would have been better to have a mini Manhattan and plan the roads and infrastructure around it.\nBut the problem with the Planning Authority was that it did not want a master plan as it would not be convenient to have to stick to it. Developers got permits and set the so-called standards, Prof. England says of the scenario, which is merely a money-making machine \u2013 a point he had already laboured during an interview a decade ago when he turned 70.\nThe only difference is that, back then, he had said: \u201cNot all is lost. Malta is still in time to save things.\n\u201cTake SmartCity,\u201d he had said 10 years ago. \u201cLet\u2019s hope the architect is smart. It is a chance in a million to produce something great.\u201d And the rest is history\u2026\n\u201cWe know the price of everything and the value of nothing,\u201d Prof. England points out. \u201cSome developments are so out of scale that they just do not make sense,\u201d he continues, referring to the St George\u2019s Bay and Paceville area.\u00a0The Planning Authority does not want a master plan as it would not be convenient to have to stick to it\nBut it was not only the fault of architects; they needed to have good clients.

The situation, however, took a turn for the worse during the procedure, when Mr Mercieca\u2019s blood pressure continued to fall, forcing doctors to give him other medication to reverse the effect of the previous ones.\nMr Zrinzo was not found responsible for the complications that may have been caused by the blood pressure but was criticised over his failure to visit his patient after the operation when both of his legs were paralysed.\u00a0\nMr Justice Mangion ruled that Mr Zrinzo deviated from a general and approved practice, resulting in a 75 per cent disability for his patient who was paralysed from the neck down.\nHe therefore ordered Mr Zrinzo and the Director General of the Health Department, as his employer, to jointly pay Mr Mercieca \u20ac123,383 in damages, including \u20ac5,000 in expenses he incurred to improve his physical condition.", "comment_count": 0, "id": 2130}, {"keywords": "", "author": "", "article_body": "These are the stories which made it to the front pages of Monday's newspapers:\nThe Times of Malta reports on shortcomings in schools' security systems, as well as on a \u20ac123,000 pay-out for a patient left paralysed after back surgery.\nL-Orizzont reports on the prime minister's comments on temporary ways to establish gender equality, as well as a tribute to Ronnie Pellegrini who died over the weekend.\nIn-Nazzjon reportes on the speech made on Sunday by Opposition leader Adrian Delia saying that unity would help the party.\nThe Malta Independent carries a story with former judge Giovanni Bonello saying that it was not illegal for a women to seek an abortion abroad.

Now even the compensation is not enough to fix the damage and degradation sustained by the place over the years [lost in court battles]. This whole saga shows the incompetence of the court.\u201d\nIt\u2019s become a familiar lament in property cases abusively requisitioned by the government or rented out privately for a pittance.\nBut now the disputes have been electrified by the emergence of a new scenario. Malta has lost case after case taken by complainants to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), whose rulings have overruled Malta\u2019s Constitutional Court at considerable financial and reputational cost to Malta.\u00a0\nExtensive research of ECHR archives by The Sunday Times of Malta has found a cluster of eight cases decided since the beginning of 2018, all lost by the Maltese government at a cumulative cost of more than \u20ac1 million (see below) in damages awarded to plaintiffs, as well as unquantifiable costs in human resources and overheads.\nThe losses have become so consistently beleaguering that two weeks ago the government brokered out-of-court settlements with the applicants in four cases that were pending in front of the ECHR.\nThe predictability of these cases has turned them into a source of bounty for a handful of lawyers. One in particular \u2013 whose name is known to this newspaper \u2013 has become the go-to lawyer for filing these cases in the ECtHR. The probability of winning the case is so high that this newspaper is informed of \u201ca couple\u201d of lawyers who solicit clients with the offer of only charging a fee for their work if they win the case.\n\u201cIt is futile for the Maltese Constitutional Court to continue to rule differently if the ECHR found a human rights breach in a particular type of case,\u201d says Joe Zammit Maempel, a veteran lawyer who has recently handled one such case.\nI think there is an element of pride in judges not wanting to submit to rulings of the European Court of Human Rights\n\u201cEighteen judgments were delivered by the Constitutional Court on a day before Christmas including my case. Damages awarded by a lower court were reduced in each of those cases.\u201d\nIn Dr Zammit Maempel\u2019s client's case the government had requisitioned 2,500 square metres of land in \u017bebbu\u0121 without having paid any compensation 50 years after the expropriation. In 2017 the convolutedly-named Civil Court First Hall (Constitutional Jurisdiction) \u2013 which will be shortened here to Civil Court \u2013 awarded his clients \u20ac50,000 in damages. The government appealed, and the Constitutional Court slashed the damages to \u20ac20,000. Now the complainants are taking the case to the ECtHR in Strasbourg.\n\u00a0\u201cThe Constitutional Court has to accept that there is a superior court where human rights are concerned, which is the ECHR, and that it has to bow to that court\u2019s directions and review its judgments accordingly,\u201d said Dr Zammit Maempel.\nSigns that Malta\u2019s Constitutional Court has adapted in response to the ECtHR\u2019s snubs of its decisions are yet to be seen. The cases have become a pattern.\nIn the case of the Zammit Maempel family mentioned at the beginning of this article, for example, their house had been rented in 1986 for 21 years. Then, in 1992, the housing department requisitioned it, flouting the principle of \u201cprotection of property.\u201d\nThe Zammit Maempels requested damages amounting to \u20ac98,000, the Civil Court awarded them \u20ac50,000, which was truncated to \u20ac12,000 by the Constitutional Court after the government appealed.\nThen the ECHR topped that by \u20ac33,000 last January, bringing the total figure to \u20ac45,000 \u2013 which is \u20ac5,000 shy of the initial amount set by the Civil Court.\u00a0\nAsked why the government was now suddenly settling claims out of court, Dr Zammit Maempel used an analogy. \u201cIf you cause a car accident and you cause damages you either pay the other party, or you are taken to court. If you do not have a case in court, then it would be better to settle out of court to avoid court expenses.\u201d\nQuestions sent to Justice Minister Owen Bonnici \u2013 including the implications of the government settling out of court with four plaintiffs two weeks ago, and what message that gives to Malta\u2019s Constitutional Court \u2013 remained unanswered by the deadline set in the email.\u00a0\nSenior lawyers who spoke to the newspaper were scathing of Malta\u2019s Constitutional Court. One lawyer who spoke on condition of anonymity described its decisions as being \u201cnonsensical.\u201d He talked of a \u201cpost-colonial hangover in its stubbornness to accept the superior status of the ECHR. It\u2019s as if there is this attitude that no one is above us anymore.\u201d\nAnother lawyer also speaking anonymously concurred: \u201cI think there is an element of pride in judges not wanting to submit to rulings of the ECHR.\u201d\n\u201cUnfortunately,\u201d he added, \u201cinstead of being the paladin of the individual\u2019s human rights, the Constitutional Court often takes other considerations and attempts to defend the government. One of those considerations may be that awarding significant damages in these property cases could create a large financial burden on the State.\u201d\n\u201cBut that is false reasoning in human rights, and we have to observe the parameters established by the ECHR.\u201d\nThe squeeze of property rights\nMalta is party to the Council of Europe\u2019s European Convention on Human Rights which is enforced by Europe\u2019s highest court, the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).\nInitial recourse for redress to human rights\u2019 violations rests with the domestic courts: the Civil Court (in its constitutional jurisdiction) in the first instance, the Constitutional Court in the second instance. Anyone aggrieved by decisions of these courts can then resort to the ECHR.\u00a0\nAll cases listed below were filed for breaches of one or both ECHR principles: \u201cprotection of property\u201d and \u201cright to an effective remedy\u201d.\u00a0 All but one of the judgments were delivered since the beginning of 2018.\nCase of Zammit Maempels: \u20ac50,000 damages awarded by Civil Court in 2013, lowered to \u20ac12,000 by Constitutional Court after government appealed in 2014, raised by an additional \u20ac33,000 on January 15, 2019 by ECHR.\nCase of Grech and others: In 2011 the Civil Court fixed compensation for pecuniary damages at \u20ac7,535, the Constitutional Court awarded an extra \u20ac5,000 in non-pecuniary damages in 2014, and ECHR upped the amount again by an additional \u20ac13,400 on January 15, 2019.\u00a0\nCase of Cachia and others: After government requisitioned property, the Civil Court ordered restitution of property and payment of damages of \u20ac30,000. Constitutional Court overturned decision of lower court on government\u2019s appeal. ECHR held on January 22, 2019 that there was breach of \u2018protection of property\u2019 but did not award damages on a technicality, without prejudicing any claims made in Maltese courts.\u00a0\nCase of Buttigieg and others: In 2014 the Civil Court dismissed claim with costs to applicants, a decision that was reconfirmed by the Constitutional Court in 2015. In 2018 the ECHR awarded them \u20ac35,500 in damages.\u00a0\nCase of Bradshaw and others: Pertaining to King\u2019s Own Band Club in Valletta, in 2013 the Civil Court awarded damages of \u20ac300,000, a decision overturned by the Constitutional Court in 2015. In 2018 the ECHR set damages at \u20ac610,700.\u00a0\nCase of B Tagliaferro and Sons Ltd: In 2012 the Civil Court assigned damages of \u20ac20,000, and in 2013 the Constitutional Court raised non-pecuniary damages by \u20ac30,000. In 2018 the ECHR added yet an additional \u20ac214,500 in damages.\u00a0\nCase of Galea and others: In 2012 the Civil Court awarded \u20ac40,000 in non-pecuniary damages, the Constitutional Court truncated the amount to \u20ac13,000 in 2013, and five years later the ECHR topped it by an additional \u20ac25,000.\u00a0\nCase of Cassar: In 2011 the Civil Court ordered tenants to vacate a property, a decision overruled by the Constitutional Court. In 2018 the ECHR awarded owners \u20ac183,000 in damages.\nCase of Apap Bologna: In 2011 the Civil Court set damages at \u20ac21,000, which were lowered to \u20ac16,000 by Constitutional Court the following year. In 2016 the ECHR awarded an additional \u20ac40,000 to claimants. \u00a0\nLawyers probe Constitutional Court in test case over \u2018exhaustion of ordinary remedies\u2019\nIn an 18-page application filed last Friday, three lawyers led by Franco Debono are probing the Constitutional Court following a partial vindication in a judgment delivered by the Civil Court First Hall (Constitutional Jurisdiction) on\u00a0 February 28, 2019.\nIt arises from the case of Stephen Pirotta who was sentenced to 18 years imprisonment over a road-rage incident that led to stabbings in 2005.\nIn the initial application three years ago, Dr Debono and his colleagues \u2013 Marion Camilleri and Amadeus Cachia \u2013 posited that denial of lawyer at the point of arrest and interrogation, and non-disclosure of the police file to the arrestee, amounted to violation of the \u201cright to a fair trial\u201d.\nThe court in its constitutional jurisdiction, presided by Judge Joseph R Micallef, adjourned the case 13 times over an 18-month period, prompting the lawyers to file a judicial protest last January 25, claiming that the delay was an additional breach of Mr Pirotta\u2019s rights. Judgment was then delivered a month later, on February 28.\nAmong others, the court\u2019s judgment entered into the merits of whether the statement given to police by Mr Pirotta was consequential to the establishment of guilt, and whether removal of statement would have determined the outcome of the prosecution. Another point made was that Mr Pirotta or his lawyers at the time of trial and criminal appeal \u2013 who were not the same lawyers filing for human rights breaches at this point in time \u2013 did not object to the police statement being used as evidence in court. An argument is made that any party who does not make use of \u2018ordinary remedies\u2019 (in this case, not objecting to inclusion of police statement) during the course of the trial or process itself could then, after the sentence is handed down, resort to \u201cconstitutional\u201d remedies in a bid to revoke the sentence.\u00a0\nThis reasoning, which is often invoked in Maltese human-rights rulings, has been denounced by justice grandee Judge Emeritus Giovanni Bonello in his recent book Misunderstanding the Constitution. Judge Emeritus Bonello, who sat on the ECtHR for 12 years, wrote that \u201cthe constitutional courts have subverted the Constitution, ludicrously and fatally, by refusing any redress to victims of human rights abuse, \u2018because they have not exhausted ordinary remedies\u2019.\u201d\nIn the application to the Constitutional Court, the lawyers latch onto the fact that the court did find a breach in human rights and awarded Mr Pirotta \u20ac3,000 in damages. They then argue that the police statement was indeed a crucial piece of evidence. They also emphasise the Maltese state\u2019s tardiness in introducing the right to lawyer at point of arrest, and that the ECHR has in the past snubbed Malta for attempting to narrow such right. The ECHR had argued that by introducing a caveat to this right \u2013 the \u201cvulnerability of the defendant\u201d \u2013 the Maltese Constitutional Court had \u201cchose[n] to contradict the letter and the spirit of the Grand Chamber\u2019s judgment\u201d.\nOn these points, the lawyers are requesting the Constitutional Court to reconfirm the breach of human rights and grant suitable remedies \u2013 by implication, the nullification of the sentence and retrial of the case.\n* Dr Zammit Maempel has nothing to do with the case of Edward Zammit Maempel and his sister mentioned in the article.

equality, however, equality between men and women does not exist,\u201d Dr Muscat said.\nHe noted that while more women had taken up employment, supported among others by initiatives such as free childcare, the gender pay gap was increasing, rather than decreasing.\nThis meant that women were either being paid the minimum wage or entering employment at the lowest levels.\nAccording to the latest data, there is an 11 per cent wage difference between men and women who do the same job, meaning that symbolically, women in Malta work for free between November 19 and the end of the year.\nAccording to Dr Muscat, there was also a gender element to poverty in Malta, where a substantial amount of those suffering material deprivation were women.\nIn keeping with the topic of gender issues, the Labour leader flagged the absence of women from the judiciary and parliament.\n\nSo far, none of the retired magistrates and judges have been women, bar Judge Ena Cremona who gave up her local post for one in the EU.\nA Labour government had therefore made it a point to \u201cshort-circuit the system\u201d with 57 per cent of its nominations for the Malta Courts being women.\nThis saw

Meanwhile, a department source said that other inspections carried out earlier in 2018 had found even more irregularities.\n\u201cIn April we found fish farms that had landed tuna illegally, killing fish without inspectors present and without the necessary permits.

A separate magisterial inquiry is looking into these allegations.\nHow did the racket come to light?\nThe wide-ranging Spanish investigation started mostly by chance, after a string of food poisoning cases hit Spain back in 2016.\u00a0Investigators discovered that the smuggled tuna behind the poisoning cases was not being treated with the minimum sanitary requirements and had dubious origins.\nTwo Malta-based ranchers have been named in the investigation \u2013 Mare Blue, owned by Spanish fishing giant Ricardo\u00a0Fuentes and Sons, and Malta Fish Farms, owned by former Elbros owner Saviour Ellul.\nJapan is the chief destination market for farmed tuna, which has the right consistency of fat to meat ratio that is highly valued in sushi.\nAround 70 per cent of tuna fattened in the Mediterranean is exported to Japan, where it fetches prices so high that Malta\u2019s legal tuna industry now generates more than \u20ac120 million a year.\nSpanish authorities believe that for almost every consignment shipped to Japan an equal amount from the illegally sourced stock was being shipped to Spain. Tests conducted on some of the irregular fish by Spain\u2019s consumer rights authority found it contained a dangerously high level of histamines and had not been properly refrigerated during transportation.\u00a0\nSpanish investigation sources have told The Sunday Times of Malta that the irregular tuna catches which originated from Italy and Malta would often start to decay en route but still get sold to consumers.\nThe main problem with supplying such tuna to the market is the dramatic increase in harmful\u00a0histamines in the meat. Histamines can be toxic from\u00a050 milligrams\u00a0per kilo of product, although EU sanitary regulations allow an absolute maximum of 200 milligrams.\u00a0\nThe Spanish sources said consumers who ended up hospitalised in Seville ate tuna containing\u00a02,584 milligrams per kilo.\u00a0Histamines in these proportions can cause heart failure and lung disease, according to an expert report incorporated in the Spanish court case.", "comment_count": 41, "id": 2150}, {"keywords": "Education", "author": "", "article_body": "Digital education in schools is the theme of a half-day event to be held on Friday from 9am to 12.30pm at the MITA Data Centre, Santa Venera, by the\u00a0eSkills Malta Foundation, in collaboration with the\u00a0Ministry for Education and\u00a0Employment.\nOutside educational circles, and sometimes also within them, few people and organisations know what digital education is being given to students at primary and secondary level.\nEveryone now accepts that people from all walks of life will increasingly need digital skills and knowledge.\u00a0This is because digital technology will be used not only by children or employees at the workplace, but practically everybody, including women at home.\u00a0\nDigital technology will be used by people at every level of an organisation or society to increase their quality of life, by students to get better education and by teachers to transmit more effective lessons.\nIndividuals who are not digital savvy will suffer in one way or another; they may even become outdated and lose their job.\u00a0To thrive in the workplace of the future, people will need to have the right digital education.

While the first, second and third such revolutions brought economic benefits, increased productivity and advanced welfare, it is often argued that wealth distribution was not equitable and benefits came at the cost of climate change and environmental sustainability.\nRapid advances that are characterising Industry 4.0 will also provide benefits and opportunities in present contexts; however, it is predicted that these will happen much faster. Unpredictable issues due to rapid changes would therefore require fast remedies in policies, regulations and action. Our educational systems and curricula will succeed depending on its capabilities of anti\u00adcipation, prevention and preparedness for Industry 4.0 and on its capacities of enabling infrastructure that supports our societies.\nSimilarly, strategies in construction methodologies should be more aligned with the more digitally developed industries. This process is revolutionising not only the way physical structures are designed and constructed but also the way buildings are maintained and used.\nIt is often argued that the latter factors are commonly undermin\u00aded, and in most buildings, ignored. Factors determining new ways and methods of building design have to be shifted from the conventional approach. The mindset of the design, function, geometry, structure and aesthetics of buildings where we live and work needs to be seen also from the perspectives of building climate, building technology, building energy and environmental consciousness.\nAlmost 50 per cent of EU\u2019s ener\u00adgy consumption is used for heating and cooling, of which 80 per cent is used in buildings. So the achievement of the Union\u2019s energy and climate goals is closely linked to efforts to renovate its building stock by giving priority to energy efficiency, and making use of the \u2018energy efficiency first\u2019 principle, as well as the deployment of renewables.\nThe achievement of the EU\u2019s energy and climate goals is closely linked to efforts to renovate its building stock\nThe EU\u2019s revised Energy Performance of Buildings Directive 2018/844, which entered into force last July, demands that EU countries have to transpose the new elements of the directive into national law by 2020. The new directive has huge potential for efficiency gains in the EU building sector, the largest single energy consumer in Europe. It includes measures that will accelerate the rate of building renovation towards more energy-efficient systems and strengthen the energy performance of new buildings, making them smarter.\nBesides political and legislative provisions, which react through strengthening efficiency and renewable source management measures, cultural and business demands are starting to focus on environment-protecting construction issues. As a result, the building industry will change decisively, requiring high-performance ar\u00adchi\u00adtecture in buildings and settlements.\nThe interdisciplinary planning approach invites, or rather necessitates collaborative working in the aspects of architecture, building services systems, building power, urbanism, settlement planning and environmental engineering. Building information modelling, building physics, building energy, mathematics, climatology, aerodynamics, fine arts and lighting engineering are shaping new ways in building supply chain.\nOur societies are without doubt experiencing rapid transformations in all aspects and forms of life brought about by Industry 4.0.

regarding a controversial \u017bejtun property.Caroline Muscat had been targeted by two libel suits filed by Patrick Dalli following five articles carried by Times of Malta in 2014 about illegal works carried out at a \u017bejtun farmhouse owned by Pada Builders Limited, a company with 99% shareholding in favour of the Dalli spouses.\nIn two parallel judgments handed down on Friday, the court of appeal declared that a series of facts reported by the journalist had been proved \u201csubstantially true,\u201d even confirmed by testimony and photographic evidence in support of her writing.\nCiting the Bordeaux Declaration of 1954 by the International Federation of Journalists, the court pointed out that \u201cRespect for truth and for the right of the public to truth is the first duty of the journalist\u201d.\nA number of facts disclosed by Ms Muscat\u2019s writings had indeed been proven, the court observed, listing the fact that illegal works had been carried out at the farmhouse situated in an ODZ area and that works were ongoing at the time when the story was published.\nMoreover, it was true that an application to sanction the works had been filed, that the property had been hit by an enforcement notice and that the case officer at the Planning Authority had recommended a refusal.\nFurthermore, the court observed that the journalist had contacted Mr Dalli before going to print.\n\u201cThis was not a case where the journalist just published facts without first communicating with the person concerned, giving the latter the opportunity to explain,\u201d said Mr Justice Anthony Ellul presiding over the appeals.\nThe fact that Mr Dalli had denied any knowledge of the said ongoing works had been left to the readers to judge, given that it was public knowledge that the applicant lived close by to the property at issue, the court went on.Although the first court had concluded that no illegal works had been carried out at the \u017bejtun property, the evidence put forward had clearly indicated otherwise.After the story had first been leaked to Times of Malta newsroom by means of a photo and explanatory note from an anonymous source, a former journalist at the newsroom had snapped a photo of workmen on the roof of the \u017bejtun property two days before the picture was uploaded on the Times of Malta portal, captioned 'Workers captured on site Two Days Ago,' namely on November 12, 2014.The testimony of that journalist together with that of Jason Desira, who had entered into a promise of sale on the farmhouse at the time of the publication of the story, proved that works were ongoing.\nPhotos of the site had even shown machinery, including a bobcat and a truck, which served as further proof of said works, the court said.\nRead: Patrick Dalli submits new plans for \u017bejtun farmhouse\nAs for Mr Dalli\u2019s complaint of having been unduly defamed by Ms Muscat\u2019s writing, the court questioned the

floorspace in excess of that approved.\n\u201cIt was evident that when originally doing all that development without a permit, the applicant did not bother to safeguard his reputation nor that of his

If parliamentarians were to act as legislators they had to have the resources and time to do so, she added.\nDr Metsola has a more definitive reply: MPs should have the chance to do their job full-time if they so wished and that should be part and parcel of a whole range of reforms of how the Maltese Parliament functioned.\nWould gender quotas work in the Maltese scenario?\nRoberta Metsola: No. Quotas simply paper over the cracks, give a false sense of security and do nothing to tackle the underlying problem with female representation in Malta and Gozo.

If there are other people who have a different approach, I welcome that,\u201d Dr Bonello said, stressing the uniqueness of the agreement\u2019s enforcement mechanism.\nContinued concerns from residents and environmental groups have centred on the height of the planned apartment blocks closest to the island entry-way, which objectors say are oversized and will obscure important vistas.\nResidents have also lamented the loss of a part of the G\u017cira promenade to accommodate new bridges, one of which will be reserved for pedestrians and cyclists to access the largely vehicle-free island, and the narrowing of the current sea channel.\nThe Environment and Resources Authority had not objected to the plans, although an impact assessment warned of significant negative effects during the eight-year construction phase.\nThe Democratic Party condemned the PA's decision and the fact that both the PL and the PN had voted in favour. It said the island would be overdeveloped, views from G\u017cira would be ruined and G\u017cira creek would be narrowed by land reclamation.\u00a0", "comment_count": 92, "id": 2215}, {"keywords": "", "author": "", "article_body": "A magistrate has postponed a decision on whether the Office of the Prime Minister's Chief of Staff Keith Schembri may be questioned about secret company 17 Black in a libel case instituted against former Opposition leader Simon Busuttil.\nMagistrate Francesco Depasquale had been due to give a decision on Thursday, but it was postponed to give Mr Schembri\u2019s lawyers a chance to reply to submissions by Dr Busuttil's lawyers on why he should be ordered to give evidence.\nIn terms of law, Mr Schembri has a right to file a reply to Dr Busuttil\u2019s written submission, which was filed after the case had been adjourned for decree.\nMr Schembri had sued Dr Busuttil over comments he made about the Panama Papers during a public activity in March 2016.\nDuring a hearing on January 24, Mr Schembri's lawyers objected to questions about 17 Black on the grounds that information about it came to light after the libel proceedings were instituted.\nBut Dr Busuttil's lawyers argued that 17 Black is a secret company named in leaked e-mails as one of two companies that would pay $2 million to Mr Schembri's and Konrad Mizzi's secret Panama companies.\nThe case has been put off to next month.\nCorrection March 8, 10.25am: The story has been updated to make it clear that the magistrate was legally obliged to give Mr Schembri time to file a written reply.\u00a0", "comment_count": 0, "id": 2216}, {"keywords": "", "author": "Edwina Brincat, Herman Grech", "article_body": "Three men accused of killing Daphne Caruana Galizia were back in court on Thursday morning, as the compilation of evidence against them resumed.

If there is less wind or sun, and energy is needed, this \u2018battery\u2019 can be used to keep the grid going, he added.\nThe project is dubbed FLASC: Floating Liquid Piston Accumulator Using Seawater Under Compression.\n\u201cIt is also a play on words, since the equipment is basically like a water container,\u201d engineer Daniel Buhagiar said.\nThe system has two pressure containers underwater that compress air. FLASC uses the compressed air for energy storage while maintaining a stable pressure.\nThe technology then converts the renewable energy supply into output.\nReliability is everything\n\u201cThink of it like a battery: the issue with renewables is the sun is not always shining and the wind is not always blowing. Most of the time, as consumers we expect a certain fixed output, so there is a need for this buffer,\u201d Dr Buhagiar continued.\nRenewable energy is intermittent and is consequently hard to predict.\n\u00a0\u201cWe want to change that intermittency into a guaranteed power supply,\u201d Dr Buhagiar said.\nEngineering experts (left to right) Tonio Sant, Daniel Buhagiar and Robert Farrugia next to their \u2018emergency battery\u2019.\nMany foreign wind turbine offshore farms have tried to solve the problem by turning to large-scale batteries. However, these can be fire hazards and are dangerous when used out at sea, Prof. Sant pointed out.\nOil and gas infrastructures are also looking for renewable energy to power their processes.\n\u201cAn oil rig can demand 95MW of energy, a quarter of the power Malta demands,\u201d Dr Buhagiar said.\n\u201cThey look to wind turbines as an option to power their system but it is a process that runs every day and all the time, so reliability is everything.\u201d\nA prototype of the FLASC project is situated at Dock No. 1, in Cospicua.\nThe researchers from the Faculty of Engineering and Institute for Sustainable Energy at the University of Malta are now eyeing Northern European markets.\nThe project is supported by the Fusion R&I Technology Development Programme of the Malta Council for Science and Technology (Project R&I 2015-044-T), the Maritime Seed Fund of Malta Maritimma, the University Research, Innovation and Development Trust and industrial partner Medserv plc.\nMaltese scientists have developed an innovative offshore energy storage system that was awarded a Statement of Feasibility by an independent certification body.
