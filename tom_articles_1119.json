treated as usual.\nThe directives, which are expected to affect about 300 patients every day, come just weeks after Times of Malta reported that the department was in such a bad state that the physiotherapists were struggling to treat patients.\nSituated at St Luke\u2019s Hospital and run by Steward Health Care, the US company that took over the 30-year government concession to manage three hospitals, the outpatient physiotherapy department is the only one of its kind on the island.\nRead: Physio equipment, service very good, Fearne claims\nThe department had not seen an upgrade in years, with physiotherapists being forced to make the best of what was available, including having to use a corridor riddled with broken tiles during sessions with patients learning to walk again, Times of Malta was told.\u00a0\nThe only treadmill available in the department had been out of order for months.\nIn comments to this newspaper on Wednesday, the president of the Malta Union of Midwives and Nurses, Paul Pace, said timelines had been sought a number of times.\n\u201cTime stood still from the day the public-private partnership (PPP) was launched, with the consequence that the physiotherapy department looks more like a museum than a modern functioning facility,\u201d he noted.\nHe said that about 75,000 patients were treated at the department every year but the clinic lacked space and equipment to cater for the needs and challenges of a modern rehabilitation facility.\nMost services meant to be offered at the department were \u201cpending\u201d due to lack poor

that, especially during bad storms, the department often flooded, with staff and patients shuffling around trying not to slip. Staff had often also been forced to use buckets to capture some of the water seeping in from the ceiling, the sources said.\n\u201cWith the commencement of the PPP, the whole service provided by the physiotherapy department deteriorated to a point where patients are seen in the main corridors of St Luke\u2019s, exposed to all sorts of temperatures.\n\u201cMost of the equipment is literally obsolete and no new additional machinery was bought, putting more strain on the clinicians. The place is debilitated in all spheres,\u201d Mr Pace commented.\nAcknowledging that timelines outlining the promised works had yet to be provided by Steward, Mr Pace noted that while his union, through its members, had provided \u201calternative areas\u201d that could be used within the department, the hospital operator still did not have \u201cany definite plans or timelines for the refurbishment and expansion of said department\u201d.\nBoth the physiotherapists and patients \u201cdeserve better\u201d, he insisted.\nContacted for a reaction following the directives, a spokeswoman said Steward had been in \u201cconstant contact\u201d with the nursing union.\nShe noted that this was the case on an ongoing basis with the view of \u201cfinding a mutually agreeable way forward\u201d.\u00a0\n\u017bminijietna \u2013 Voice of the Left reacts\nIn a reaction on Thursday,\u00a0\u017bminijietna \u2013 Voice of the Left, said that the government should revise the health policy \"with regard to the PPP\".\u00a0\n\"What is happening at St Luke's Hospital, managed by Steward Health Care, the American company that took over the management of the hospital for 30 years, is a confirmation that public-private partnerships are not the ideal model to improve the quality of the services provided.\"\nWith regards to working conditions, the leftist organisation \u017bminijietna expressed solidarity with the physiotherapy department, where workers were subject to inferior working conditions, and a work environment that lacked healthcare facilities.\u00a0\nThe group valled on the government to address the issues, arguing that the health care system should remain \"under public control\".\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0", "comment_count": 10, "id": 3323}, {"keywords": "", "author": "", "article_body": "Prime Minister Joseph Muscat and Opposition leader Adrian Delia debated abortion, the environment, and migration, among a myriad of other issues in a final TV showdown on Wednesday ahead of the European elections.\nThe two leaders largely stuck to their respective campaign messages but Dr Muscat appeared to be more confrontational than he had been in previous debates with Dr Delia.\u00a0\nModerator Mario Xuereb rang in the first round with a toughly worded question on abortion for Dr Delia.\nThe PN, Mr Xuereb said, appeared to be approaching the election as one it knew it would lose. Dr Delia was raising the spectre of abortion, but this could not be imposed by the EU, could it? And, by framing the election as a referendum on abortion, surely he had just played into the pro-choice camp\u2019s hands, since it was an open secret he would not be winning this poll?\nReplying, Dr Delia said the PN had clear proposals for both the EP and the local council elections, giving a brief overview.\nTurning to abortion, he said the PN was adamantly \u201cin favour of life\u201d.\nOn the other hand, the European socialists were calling for the introduction of a \u201cright to abortion\u201d.

Her other option was to leave within one week.\nLara was left with no choice but to look for a place elsewhere.

This was \u2013 surprisingly \u2013 a fairly common occurrence.\n\nThis oddity had led to the creation of an action under Canon Law, commonly known as the action against the \u2018jactitation of marriage\u2019 (derived from the Latin word jactare, which means \u2018to throw about or boast of in public, to the detriment of someone else\u2019) \u2013 mostly prevalent in common law jurisdictions.\u00a0\nA person could ask the ecclesiastical courts (and later, the common courts) to declare that a marriage being attributed to him or her never existed, and that the boaster be enjoined to refrain from making that claim any further in the future. This was (ironically, one could say) an action tantamount to defamation against slanderous accusations.\nA famous action against the jactitation of marriage was brought in an English court in spring of 1819 by Edward Lord Hawke against a Lady named Elizabeth Augusta Corri. He lamented that she had been falsely styling herself as his wife, and therefore unfairly assuming the title of Lady Hawke. The complaint prepared by Lord Hawke\u2019s solicitors inadvertently reveals the precise purpose of this action:\n\u201cThat Lord Hawke is, in no way, married or united with this lady, (meaning, as the Court presumes, neither in fact nor in law); that she has falsely and maliciously boasted and reported that she is married to him, whereas, in fact, no marriage has taken place; and that, on her being desired to desist from such conduct, she paid no attention, but continued, falsely and maliciously, to boast and report such fact, to the no small prejudice and injury of the complainant.\u201d\nLord Hawke was correct: the parties were indeed not married. But to his shock and horror, he still lost the case. It turned out that Lord Hawke was in an adulterous relationship with Corri, and had even allowed her to introduce herself as his wife, but only while they were cohabiting. That \u2013 to the court \u2013 was sufficient to dismiss Lord Hawke\u2019s suit.\nThis is an example of many cases of the sort.\nIn time, the number of suits against the jactitation of marriage slowly dwindled, and in most jurisdictions, such an action did not survive the dawn of the 20th century; but it did inspire one similar action which forms part of Maltese laws today: the jactitation suit.\nTrue to its brother, the jactitation suit (in Maltese: jattanza or kaw\u017ca ta\u2019 millantazzjoni) is an action available to a person who is facing a claim made against him by another, which for some reason or another, is not followed by a lawsuit. It may be brought by the holder of a right attacked by a claim. The most important element in the action is that a claim is vaunted (the jactitation), in some judicial act or in writing, which runs counter to the rights of some other person. Furthermore, the claim challenged must not be in respect of an uncertain right, contingent upon any event or condition, or of a right with regard to which no action can, for the time being, be taken; it must refer to a determinate right.\nIf the person against whom the claim is made wishes to be forever liberated from such a claim, he may \u2013 within a year of such jactitation \u2013 demand that the court establishes a term (not exceeding three months) by which the claimant must institute proceedings in furtherance of his claim, or else be enjoined in perpetual silence.\nPlaintiffs had only moved to institute the action 20 months later, and therefore outside the one-year period providedby law\nIn other words, one is told to speak now or forever hold his peace.\u00a0\nThe case of Philip Dimech pro et noe et vs Joseph Galea, decided by the Civil Court, First Hall on May 14 was an attempt by plaintiffs to exercise this action at law.\nThey complained that respondent had alleged some sort of right on a property which was theirs \u2013 this by means of a legal letter dated February 4, 2017. The action was instituted on October 12, 2018 \u2013 that is, more than a year later.\nIn its judgment, the court went into great detail in analysing the legal principles surrounding the \u2018jactitation suit\u2019. It explained that this institute at law satisfies both legal and social necessities; disputes are not left hanging without being resolved, and a person is not allowed to perturb another with claims and pretensions that are never brought to court for final determination.\nThis does not mean that this is an action that can be brought impetuously. Equally (if not more) important is the rule that one cannot be forced to file a court case (invitus agree nemo cogitur), and as eloquently stated by Prof. Caruana in his renowned Notes on Civil Procedure, the \u2018jactitation suit\u2019 is no less than a violation of the principle that no one may be compelled, against his will, to institute proceedings and reduce to an insignificant term the normal period for the institution of a lawsuit.\nIt is perhaps a necessary evil, that however obliges the court to apply the law strictly.\nArticle 403 of the Code of Civil Procedure (Chapter 12 of the Laws of Malta) obliges the recipient of claim to act within a year of any jactitation, that is a claim which he seeks to silence.\u00a0\nThe court correctly argued that this meant that the legislator in Malta wanted to drastically limit the timeframe in which such an action may be exercised (unlike some of its foreign counterparts, which grant no timeframe).\nThe court noted that the respondent had forwarded his claim in writing on February 4, 2017, and plaintiffs had only moved to institute the action 20 months later, and therefore outside the one-year period provided by law.\nHence \u2013 the court concluded \u2013 since one of the core elements of the action was missing, there was no need to further examine the other elements. It rejected the plaintiffs\u2019 action, and ordered them to pay the expenses.\nCarlos Bugeja is senior associate at Azzopardi, Borg & Abela Advocates.", "comment_count": 0, "id": 3397}, {"keywords": "", "author": "", "article_body": "A group of Gozitan developers, who are among the largest on the two islands, have categorically denied a claim of \u201cantagonism\u201d made against them by Planning Authority chairman Johann Buttigieg.\nThe developers are from the companies DTX, J.

Some 100 dogs were being kept in a space that should have been hosting only 40.\nAfter Dr Montebello flagged the issue with the Ministry for Animal Rights, work kicked off on new kennels which will ultimately be able to host some 50 dogs in adequate conditions.\nThis will still not be enough to host all the rescued animals, but it was a good start, he said.\nHe is meanwhile concerned that the lack of resources are not only detrimental to the directorates themselves but also to the Commissioner\u2019s office, whose officers promote animal welfare at schools.\nExposing children to the current conditions at G\u0127ammieri during some school trip could unravel the work carried out by the Commissioner\u2019s office to raise awareness about animals\u2019 well-being.\nRaising awareness about animal cruelty and changing people\u2019s mentality was quite challenging considering that for centuries people were taught that animals were created to serve human beings, he said.\nThis mentality also led people to pluck animals from their natural habitat and keep them in zoos, circuses or in urban environments for their own pleasure.\nEnforcement efforts undermined\nDo you agree with your predecessor that Malta is no place for dangerous animals?\nYes, dangerous animals are wild animals \u2013 they should be living in their natural habitat and not in cities with people. \u00a0\nWhat about exotic animals?\nThe name itself implies that these animals are from exotic places. As Commissioner I want every creature to live in its natural habitat.\nIf they were not born in the wild, we need to ensure that their habitat is as close as possible to their natural one. This is difficult to achieve in Malta, and the best place for them remains the wild.\nHas the Commission received reports about organised dog fights and the illegal slaughtering of horses to feed big cats?\nDespite the reports that have done the rounds in the media, and the claims made in Parliament, no one has yet brought forward any evidence, not even anonymously. So far no one has gone to the police or the directorates with proof or specific details.\nI am still following up the issues and the authorities are checking for dog bites whenever they carry out surprise visits at places hosting dogs that are usually used in organised fights, such as pit bulls.\nBetween 2015 and this year, 50 people were accused in court of animal cruelty. We don\u2019t yet know how many have been convicted. Is this number too small?\nWhen this data was published in Parliament, I asked for details about each case on March 15. So far I have only been informed that 14 fell under the responsibility of the Veterinary Regulation Directorate, however there is no available information about how most of them proceeded.\nThis serious lack of updated and readily available records led me to conclude that the same factors compromising obligatory inspections are also undermining any efforts of enforcement and subsequent prosecutions, without which the whole structure for the ultimate protection of animal rights is doomed to collapse.\nDo you think the Commissioner should have more enforcement powers?\nMy role is to flag issues with the directorates and file a report with the Minister for Animal Rights if no action is taken.\nRather than direct enforcement, I think this office could have the right to order directorates to take action about their shortcomings, instead of reporting them to the minister.\nAccording to the law my job is like that of an Ombudsman, however, so far whenever I flagged an issue with the minister, it was followed up with an investigation.", "comment_count": 14, "id": 3399}, {"keywords": "", "author": "Sarah Carabott", "article_body": "The Ivorian community in Malta thanked the police for its investigation into the murder of Lassana Cisse and for arresting two men allegedly behind the racially-motivated crime.\nCommunity leader Ousmane Dicko also appealed to the same Police Force to continue doing its job and protect people, including African migrants.\u00a0We have seen people who were supposed to be protecting us carry out such acts\n\u201cThe migrant community is very afraid at the moment as we have seen people who were supposed to be protecting us carry out such acts,\u201d he said.\u00a0\nThe comments by Mr Dicko, a friend of Mr Cisse for some years, follow the arraignment of 21-year-old Francesco Fenech and 22-year-old Lorin Scicluna on Sunday.\u00a0\nThe two soldiers pleaded not guilty to the murder of Mr Cisse on Triq il-\u0120ebel in Birzebugia, the attempted murder of another two men and a hit-and-run incident on the same site earlier this year.\u00a0Lassana Cisse was murdered in cold blood\nRead: 'My head is full of desperate thoughts' \u2013 shooting survivors open up\u00a0\nThe drive-by shooting on April 6 has sent ripples of fear among black people and migrants in Malta, Mr Dicko, who has been in Malta for 15 years, said.\nMr Cisse died on the spot, metres away from two young men - a 27-year-old from Guinea and a 28-year-old from Gambia \u2013 who were injured but survived the drive-by shooting.\nAppeal by distraught mother\nA father-of-three from the Ivory Coast, Mr Cisse was himself an only child, and his distraught mother has appealed for her son\u2019s body to be returned to Ivory Coast.\nMr Dicko said she was still coming to terms with his death, and paying farewell to his body could bring some closure to the elderly woman.\nHowever, flying Mr Cisse\u2019s body to the Ivory Coast, once released, was going to prove quite challenging because of the costs involved.\nMr Dicko said the cost could run in the thousands, and at the moment the community is still looking for funds.\nOn Sunday, Archbishop Charles Scicluna\u00a0 announced that the family would be getting help from the proceeds of the Archbishop\u2019s Charity Fund Concert 2019,\u00a0 held on Sunday at St Paul's Cathedral in Mdina.", "comment_count": 38, "id": 3400}, {"keywords": "", "author": "", "article_body": "A 58-year-old motorcyclist from Bir\u017cebbu\u0121a was grievously injured on Sunday in a traffic accident in Mellie\u0127a.\nThe police said the accident happened in Triq il-Marfa at 10.15am.\nThe rider lost control of his Yamaha and fell off.\nHe was taken to Mater Dei Hospital by ambulance.\nThe police are investigating.", "comment_count": 0, "id": 3401}, {"keywords": "", "author": "Philip Leone Ganado", "article_body": "Nine years ago, before anyone knew how huge it was going to be, the HBO TV series\u2019 first season was partly filmed in Malta.

That had a ripple effect on everyone\u2019s nerves. I found out from other people that in later seasons the production solved a lot of those problems with larger crews and larger budgets.\u201d\nDoes he feel any disappointment that Game of Thrones never returned to Malta after that first season, and arguably hit its greatest peaks away from our shores?\nMr Mallia insisted that the decision not to return \u2013 most of the scenes shot in Malta were moved to Dubrovnik in Croatia for later seasons \u2013 was, despite public perception, completely unrelated to the environmental controversy at Dwejra, where construction sand was strewn over fossil-rich stones.\n\u201cAnyone who watches the show knows they have different looks, and it was clear from the first year that Malta did not offer that variety that was required by the series,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIf the experience had been entirely positive, perhaps some later stuff might have been filmed here, but I think it was a good lesson for authorities and service providers, and while it was unpleasant and cost the production quite a bit of money, speaking nine years later, I think it was probably blown out of proportion.\u201d\nMr Mallia has a mixed view as to the impact Game of Thrones has had on Malta and its film servicing industry, warning that the global hype and fan culture surrounding the show does not necessarily reflect the production realities.\n\u201cMalta has had its fair share of productions before and since,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course because this is one of the most-watched, it\u2019s brought more awareness to Malta.

Dr Delia had argued before the court that the Attorney General\u2019s refusal to grant him a copy of the full inquiry was discriminatory, seeing that Prime Minister Joseph Muscat and Labour Party officials had been given access to the same inquiry. However, Mr Justice Robert Mangion dismissed Dr Delia\u2019s argument saying the situation would have been different had both the Prime Minister and Opposition leader been subjects of the inquiry, and only Dr Muscat had been granted a full copy of its findings. Dr Delia vowed to appeal the decision.

They were often not sure how well the property had been maintained and to what standards it had first been built. \u00a0\nLaws that in some cases dated back to the 19th century, such as certain sanitation regulations, were compounded by a convoluted regulatory landscape and the different professionals involved in the sector had varying degrees of training and liability.\u00a0\nThis, he said, could not remain unchanged as the country steamed ahead towards the development of large-scale projects and high-rise buildings.\nThe consultation document takes stock of the complex legal landscape in Malta and compares it to best practices in countries ranging from Scotland to Malaysia.\nSimplify the system\nIn a nutshell, the KTP is proposing a broad reform of the building and construction regulation regime that covers all areas of the sector in a simple but comprehensive system, catering for small and large projects.\u00a0\nFor starters, a new system of certification and approved documents would be introduced, including newly written building and construction codes.\nThe role of periti and engineers would be more focused on design, setting of specifications, monitoring works and certifying compliance at completion in accordance with the new codes. Professional liabilities of a number of people involved (architects, engineers, masons, site managers, etc.) would be clearly set out in line with European norms.\nToday masons are still being taught skills in an informal setting, much of which is not compatible with modern day building techniques.\nProject managers, who are meant to monitor progress, are often the person behind the development, with little to no experience in health and safety on construction sites.\u00a0\nDaily inspections\nThe KTP believes that large projects such as high-rise towers or hospitals should have their engineering works certified by an independent firm not involved in the project to ensure adherence to laws.\nAccording to the KTP, it is also time for new professionals to inspect and monitor construction sites on a day-to-day basis.\nContractors should be registered in a bid to raise quality and standards, something the Developers\u2019 Association has also been pushing for. \u00a0\nStreamlined pre-construction processes would have to be carried out, including an independent review of civil engineering inputs such as structural analysis and design, as well as fire prevention and fire safety of major projects and some public buildings.\u00a0\nAnd a register of independent professional building and construction inspectors will need to be set up.\u00a0\nThe full list of proposals is available for download on the KTP website www.kamratalperiti.org.", "comment_count": 26, "id": 3414}, {"keywords": "", "author": "", "article_body": "The Sunday Times of Malta reports on the arrest of two men suspected of killing a man in a racially-motivated attack last month.\nThe newspaper also gives prominence to its second European election survey, which suggests Labour\u2019s lead has narrowed but remains commanding.\nThe Malta Independent on Sunday leads with extracts from interviews with Joseph Muscat and Adrian Delia and reports on the arrest of two soldiers for having killed migrant Lassana Cisse.\nMalta Today also focuses on the murder of Mr Cisse, with a headline stating \u201cIn cold blood\u201d.
