The tuna was then resupplied to fishmongers and other sales points throughout Europe.\nThe racket is believed to have gone on for a number of years. Spanish investigators only sniffed out the case after an outbreak of clusters of food poisoning led to investigations into the supply chain of tuna.\u00a0\n\u201cThis investigation shows that illegal tuna can also be a danger to human health,\u201d said Alessando Buzzi, a regional specialist on Bluefin tuna who works for the Worldwide Fund for Nature (WWF). \u201cNow we have to make sure that this illegal trade is eliminated to protect not just the environment, but also consumers.\u201d\nAlthough Operation Tarantelo pinned Mare Blu Farm, one of Malta\u2019s five tuna farms, as the source of the illegal tuna, sources privy to the investigation by Maltese police said that another Maltese farm, whose name is being withheld, has been mentioned peripherally in the Spanish investigative report.\nCharlon Gouder, CEO of the Federation of Maltese Aquaculture Producers, maintained that none of the four tuna farms that are members of the federation \u2013 Mare Blu Farm is not a member \u2013 have been investigated.\nPolice sources said that the investigation by the Maltese police is still in its infancy.\u00a0\u00a0\nMonitoring of tuna farming\nThe Sunday Times of Malta has managed to chart the modus operandi of the tuna racket.\nThe Mediterranean tuna fishery is probably the most controlled fishery in the world. Catch quotas are imposed on fishing nations around the Mediterranean, which fish for tuna either by hooks attached to surface longlines or purse seine nets that supply live fish to the tuna farms.\nWe have to make sure that this illegal trade is eliminated to protect not just the environment, but also consumers\nMonitoring takes place most intensely on the purse seiners and the transfer to the so-called \u2018tuna ranches\u2019 where tuna are fattened and eventually slaughtered. Two observers, one from the country of origin of the purse seiner and another from the country of destination for fattening, are stationed on purse seiners during fishing runs.\nAs soon as tuna is scooped in the huge nets, a report is transmitted to the European Fisheries Control Agency (EFCA), which deploys a patrol boat with inspectors on board. EFCA inspectors then monitor the tuna during transfer to carrier cages, estimating the number and total weight of tuna, inputting the information into an electronic database and tagging an electronic catch certificate.\nThe tuna is then slowly towed to the farms in the carrier cages for fattening. It usually takes weeks to reach Malta-based farms.\nThen the transfer of the fish from cages to pens is filmed and monitored by inspectors from EFCA, the European Commission, the Maltese Department of Fisheries and Aquaculture, and ICCAT (the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tuna). The estimated weight of the tuna is compared to the estimates at the point of catch, and, if any discrepancies are found, excess tuna is released back in the wild.\nThen, throughout the fattening period in the summer, department personnel also conduct inspections. This involves, among other things, random inspections by divers swimming among the tuna in the pens, estimating the number of tuna and cross-checking with relevant catch and stocking documentation.\u00a0\nThis is where the department has been particularly deficient. According to a report by the National Audit Office published last year, the enforcement unit with the department is understaffed by a tally of 65 personnel. Environment Minister Jos\u00e9 Herrera talked about this in Parliament last week, maintaining that the government has been unable to fill vacancies, especially divers, and that the department is looking into outsourcing some operations.\u00a0\nAsked for additional specifics, a spokesperson for Dr Herrera wrote that \u201cthe department is drawing up an action plan related to the recommendations made by NAO including that specifically related to a review of existing resources. In the meantime action will be taken to beef up staff but the process will be a dynamic one to be able to align with changes in regulations at ICCAT level.\u201d\nNow it is also known that Mare Blu Farm allegedly got away with systematic overstocking by illegally caught tuna. The farm has a stocking quota of 3,000 tons and, if estimates of Operation Tarantelo are correct, it suggests that the farm may have been stocking an additional 2,500 tons of illegally caught tuna.\nIllegal tuna is sourced from undeclared catches. It could not be established whether Operation Tarantelo pinpointed any of the vessels involved in illegal fishing, or how the illicitly caught tuna was spirited to the farm in Malta.\nThe Japanese connection\nJapan is the chief destination market for farmed tuna, which has the right consistency of fat to meat ratio that is highly valued in sushi and sashimi. In fact around 70 per cent of tuna fattened in the Mediterranean is exported to Japan, where it fetches prices so high that Malta\u2019s legal tuna industry now generates more than \u20ac120 million euros.\nIn the modus operandi uncovered by Operation Tarantelo, it was estimated that for almost every consignment shipped to Japan an equal amount from the illegally sourced stock was being shipped to Spain.\nThese parallel, duplicate shipments of equal quantities made use of duplicate paperwork \u2013 only the destinations were different. The certificates attached to the consignment dispatched to Japan would be genuine; photocopies of the certificates would then also provide cover for the illegally-caught and farmed tuna dispatched to Spain.\nAlthough some evidence suggests that some shipments might have been transported by seacraft to ports in France and perhaps also Italy, an unspecified proportion of shipments were put on trucks that boarded ferries of Virtu to Sicily and Grimaldi to unspecified ports, then making their way overland to their Spanish destination.\nImproved controls needed\nAlthough the WWF\u2019s Alessando Buzzi said it was not certain at this point whether France and Italy were involved in some illegal fishing of tuna uncovered in Operation Tarantelo, or were simply waypoints along the smuggling route from Malta to Spain, the glare of the investigations is now mainly fixed on Malta.\n\u201cA national audit in Malta showed that there are systematic deficiencies in the Department of Fisheries and Aquaculture,\u201d Mr Buzzi said. \u201cOne of the big problems in Malta appears to be deficiencies in human resources.\u201d\n\nSome systems of enforcement did work. It was mentioned in Parliament last May that 800 tons of tuna had been released after it was found to be in excess of the recorded catch statistics.\nA source in the fisheries department said that the tally of tuna released by the department in 2017 and 2018 now stands at 2,000 tons (including the 800 tons mentioned in Parliament). These were found to be in excess of the catch estimates at the point of transfer into the fattening cages.\nUnresolved questions remain about whether these fish might have been picked up from undeclared fishing throughout the weeks-long journey to Malta, or were simply variations between catch estimates and more accurate estimates at the point of transfer to farms.\nIn conversations with Mr Buzzi, it emerged that a ploy among an unspecified proportion of farms in the Mediterranean is to overinflate the fishes\u2019 growth rates during fattening to account for unrealistic increases in the cumulative weight of tuna held in pens at slaughter.\n\u201cSome farms declare growth rates of 76 per cent in three months of ranching,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not credible from a biological perspective. Tuna only grow by about a third of their weight at the fattening stage, and such cases are potential indicators for extra fish introduced in the cages illegally before harvesting.\u201d\nMr Buzzi was talking generally about stratagems in tuna farms in the Mediterranean and did not specifically implicate any of the Maltese tuna farms in these ruses. Yet this is something that was tackled in Malta in 2017: the normal growth rate of tuna has been enshrined in Maltese rules to preempt any unrealistic inflation of growth figures. This, Dr Herrera\u2019s spokesperson said, \u201cwas introduced by Malta to ensure a higher degree of control.\u201d\nWWF, together with a raft of other international environment organisations including Greenpeace and Oceana, last November wrote to the European Commission asking for an investigation into illegalities in tuna farming. Environment Commissioner Karmenu Vella wrote back in early January to announce that an investigation was under way.\nMr Buzzi said: \u201cWe are engaging with the European Commission to find and make public the potential malfunctioning of the fishery control systems. We also want the Commission to investigate potential misuse of European funds by tuna farms.\u201d\nA spokesperson for the European Commission told this newspaper that the Commission is \u201cworking\u201d with EU countries and regulatory entities \u201cto strengthen the traceability and control of live Bluefin tuna and to address the loopholes identified since the start of the Tarantelo operation.\u201d\nThe spokesperson would not say when and if the report of the \u201caudit\u201d would be published.\nMalta is the largest player in the tuna ranching industry \u2013 it has the largest tuna farming capacity \u2013 the other major tuna-farming countries are Spain, Turkey and Croatia. Italy and France have a preponderance of purse seiners that supply live tuna to the farms, including those in Malta. France never allowed tuna ranching or farming. Italy\u2019s tuna farms all ceased operations several years ago.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cTuna farms in Italy were forced to relocate far from shore because of environmental issues,\u201d said Mr Buzzi, who is based in Rome.\u00a0\n\"This caused the cages to be battered in bad weather, allowing the tuna to escape and pushing up costs due to losses. An additional factor was falling tuna quotas. All of this made it too expensive and risky to install tuna-farming operations.\"\nMr Buzzi talks of additional controls that WWF advocates on tuna farms, including a ban on any unused portion of the quota being carried over to the following year, something the EU is implementing (see box).\n\u201cControls have to be improved in the tuna farming industry,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course any controls would be futile if you have corruption.\u201d\nCommission tightens oversight\nThe European Commission has been in contact with the relevant authorities on the Tarantelo investigation and will continue to follow up the case with the Member States concerned, this newspaper has been told.\nThe Commission, a spokesman said, wanted to ensure that the authorities, fishing vessels and operators in these countries \u201cabide by the rules set by the relevant Union legislation and international treaties\u201d.\nUsing language that diplomatically sidesteps direct criticism of Malta\u2019s systematic failures \u2013 the size of illicit trade in tuna uncovered in Malta is equivalent to a fifth of the yearly EU\u2019s total tuna catch quota \u2013 the Commission talked of carrying out \u201cregular audits in tuna farms across Europe\u201d.\nThe new measures reinforce the control of live Bluefin tuna\n\u201cThe European Commission takes the findings of these audits very seriously,\u201d the spokesperson said in written replies. \u201cWe are now in the process of discussing corrective measures with member states authorities, including Maltese authorities.\u201d\nThe statement goes into detail about regulation at national and EU level, defining the limits to the Commission\u2019s legal reach over Member States and how it would be fulfilling its legal responsibilities.\nThe Commission, the spokesperson writes, is actively working with European Fisheries Control Agency (EFCA) and International Commission for Conservation of Atlantic Tuna (ICCAT) to intensify scrutiny over live tuna fishery and farming operations.\u00a0\nThe spokesperson talks of new measures approved last November \u201cthat will enter into force on 21 June 2019 [at the beginning of the tuna fishing season].

Whenever I have been asked about anything, I was able to give a reply about everything, be it in the media or other fora. Factually, I can do nothing else. Facts are facts, fiction is fiction and lies are lies. However, it has been quite some time since I was questioned on certain issues which go back a long way. I meet thousands of people but these lies and rumours are not raised.\nAre you saying that the FIAU report in which you were mentioned in money laundering activities and a Soho-based prostitution racket is a fabrication?\nThe money laundering allegation is a downright lie based on manipulated and incorrect information. I know nothing about the FIAU report, and if it is true that the police have been aware since March last year of certain allegations, the fact that they never spoke to me certifies their incompetence.\nWe are simply building more buildings rather than constructing our future\nI was never personally involved nor gave any advice in anything related to money laundering. There was one allegation on which I gave an explanation countless times based on hard evidence, including to the Times of Malta. If there is somebody who does not want to believe documented facts, there is little more that I can do.\nAs for your personal finances, this newspaper last month enquired if you still had any pending tax bills, but you did not reply. The story was based on an e-mail addressed to you that was sent in January 2018, which outlined the agreement reached on a pending tax bill totalling \u20ac81,751 for the period 2007-2013 and another one of \u20ac64,086 for the period 2014-2017. While you had said that the first had been settled, you had refused to answer on the second, saying you needed to see the documentation first. Are you now in a position to confirm that this bill has been settled?\nYou are asking me a question on a document which I have never seen.\n[Dr Delia is shown a copy of this e-mail]\nI have no recollection whatsoever of this e-mail. Had I been prepared beforehand I would have brought my records and replied on the spot.\nHow can you be unable to recollect if a \u20ac64,000 tax bill is still pending or not? This is a lot of money.\nI can assure you I have no such pending bill. I have documented evidence about this.\nCan you produce it to lay everybody\u2019s mind to rest on the matter?\nHad I known about the question beforehand I would have. I never went to the Inland Revenue Department, as the accountant used to handle such matters for me. If you are interested in my personal finances, I am available to set up a meeting with my accountant and give you a detailed month by month breakdown. I have no pending bills.\nRead: Income tax saga comes back to haunt Adrian Delia\nWhy did not you say so in the first place and produced the evidence at a later stage?\nYour document is no evidence at all!\n[Dr Delia interrupts the interview and goes to his desk to look for a document. Meanwhile, PN media chief Pierre Portelli, who was present throughout the interview, interjects remarks including that the Times of Malta has an agenda against Dr Delia. The interview resumes a while later following a colourful exchange, with the tax issue left pending.]\nWith the EP and council elections just three months away, the gap between the PN and PL is not getting any narrower according to the latest Malta Today survey. Is not this a very worrying sign for you?\nMy concern is not this but whether we have enough time to persuade enough people that the country is not heading in the right direction. I have been at the helm for 18 months and my initial task was to restructure the party and face a number of internal challenges. It is not good for the country to adopt a policy whereby the only drive behind economic growth is a rise in population, as this is not sustainable for an EU Member State with the highest population density.\u00a0\n'We are not attracting new banks or serious financial institutions'. Photo: Mark Zammit Cordina\nThe government is importing thousands of foreign construction workers in response to the needs of unplanned development. We are simply building more buildings rather than constructing our future. The government is measuring success solely in terms of economic growth but this is not reflecting people\u2019s spending power. The construction industry is doing well, but in the last six months there have been cash flow problems.\nNonetheless, the party in government is going from strength to strength. Does not this contradict what you are saying?\nWhen an economy is overheating, the consequences will only emerge at a later stage. It is like giving children unlimited access to candy. They will enjoy it at first but when it starts harming them they will regret it.\nAre you saying there is an economic bubble which will soon burst?\nI am not saying it is a bubble as my job as a politician is not to scaremonger. My point is that such a model is not sustainable as there are physical constraints. No effort is being made to attract value-added economic sectors.\nOne of the government\u2019s biggest projects was to attract blockchain and cryptocurrency investors, which rely heavily on the banking sector. Nonetheless, the government first ruined Malta\u2019s reputation, then the Finance Minister ignored the warnings sounded by the European Banking Authority, did nothing to strengthen the safeguards of this sector, and eventually the Prime Minister appealed to the banks not to be so stringent. Subsequently, a global bank [HSBC] warned that their profits had fallen by 23 per cent due to Malta\u2019s reputational damage.\nWe are not attracting new banks nor serious financial services institutions while the banks are being encouraged to break the law.\nCan you elaborate on this?\u00a0\nJoseph Muscat has lamented that banks are being too stringent when it comes to loans. He urged them to be more lax. Procedures such as due diligence and know-your-client have to be followed. Certain parameters need to be adhered to, like having a healthy distribution of loans across various economic sectors, so as not to have all eggs in one basket, in this case the construction industry.\nThe government is creating problems and shifting the blame on others. It has no solutions on pensions and tries to justify its decision to bring in thousands of foreign workers, saying these are necessary to guarantee pensions. And he blames the people for living longer when the increase in life expectancy should be a reason to celebrate as it is the result of a better quality of life.\nAre you saying that the PN is still trailing heavily in the polls because the negative repercussions of certain government policies are not yet being felt?\nThis is one of the reasons. The second is that Labour has only been in government for five years.\nBut the norm is that the decline of a party in government starts in the second legislature, where we are right now.\nThe feedback I am receiving is that people are starting to feel the pinch of corruption and have less money in their pockets. Meanwhile, the government is unashamedly using its power of incumbency to convey its message. At the Office of the Prime Minister alone there are 27 people with this duty. I believe that people are realizing what is going on, especially pensioners, families depending on one breadwinner and young people seeking to buy their first home.\nYet, this is not reflected in the polls\nThing will start to change after some time. I feel that there are already signs that this is happening but it might not necessarily have an immediate impact on opinion polls. The largest survey is that done with the electorate.\nLet us not forget that the Opposition suffered two landslide defeats and this affects its ability to persuade voters. I feel that not enough efforts to renew the party were made between 2013 and 2017, and I am trying to address this matter.\nHowever, it takes time before a party can project itself as reformed and regenerated. We have started outlining proposals in sectors like the fight against cancer, agriculture, pre-budget documents and the work-life balance directive by the MEPs.\nLet us not forget that our resources are limited, unlike the government that can also rely on PBS, which at times reports issues in a certain manner. Recently PBS changed Malta\u2019s ranking in the corruption index issued by Transparency International.\nWhat are the party\u2019s expectations in the local council elections? Where is the PN expecting to make gains?\nMy personal wish is to win back Birkirkara. Among the localities I visited, Iklin, which has been led by the PN for 23 years, stands out, as the council has developed a healthy relationship with the entire community. This is completely different from Rabat which is led by Labour.\nThis is only part of the picture. The PN had problems of its own in St Paul\u2019s Bay. So the PN is no guarantee either.\nFair point. The party is giving a lot of importance to local councils like Si\u0121\u0121iewi which is taking initiatives such as a night shelter for the elderly, a children\u2019s council and roadworks in rural areas. It has also developed a bond with residents. This is exactly what we want. On the other hand Labour has stripped councils of important responsibilities like roads, domestic waste collection and encroachment permits, and has starved them of funds.\nThe latest example is the setting up of the Gozo Regional Authority which lacks executive powers and is completely dominated by the ministry.\nIn the case of St Paul\u2019s Bay, the PN lost its majority as a result of the defection of two councillors and consequently the party ended up in a weak position. Our target will be to have a new but more united majority in this locality.\nThe bottom line is that local council elections are a gauge for any party seeking to make inroads. What is the party targeting?\nWe are trying to attract new blood, targeting certain localities where the PN had lost its majority, seeking new ones and at least gaining a seat.\nPeople are starting to feel the pinch of corruption and have less money in their pockets\nDo you subscribe to the view that in the event of a resounding defeat, you should resign in the best interests of the party so as to stand a chance in the next general election?\nI did not venture into politics on a two-year project. That would have been arrogant and imprudent. This was no experiment. I believe the PN needs to renew itself. I need to measure myself in the 2022 general election. The forthcoming elections are a test and we need to do our best to overcome the first hurdle. My considerations when the result is out is to rectify and understand what went wrong and improve on our successes.\nWould you not seriously think about resigning if, deep down, you consider yourself a liability to the party?\nIf such extraordinary circumstances were to arise, I would resign as I would not only be harming the party but the country. It does not have to be an election. However, so far I have felt the complete opposite, as I have been given huge support at every step. Whenever I did not have backing, I managed to persuade the doubters and move forward. Certainly, I have not reached out to everybody yet.\nThe leadership has no perks but sacrifices, work and responsibilities. My sole satisfaction is to give something back to party and country.\n[At this point Dr Delia\u2019s secretary hands him a document in the form of a certificate from the Inland Revenue, dated May 14, 2018, which said that he had no pending bills with the department. The interview shifts back to the tax issue. He insists that he had already shown this document to this newspaper but not to the interviewer.]\nWhat is the reason that this \u20ac64,000 bill was never mentioned, not even in the personal audit you had published on the eve of the leadership election in 2017?\nI cannot say as I have never seen the document you produced. \u20ac64,000 does not exist in my mind. But if there had been any other pending amount, it has been settled. The only exception is the period of 2017 in which I transitioned from private practice until I became Opposition leader, but I have already put aside money to settle that as well.\nDo you take any salary from the party as leader?\nNo. I had announced this from the very beginning, and never received any remuneration from the party. However, I had also said that there would be nothing wrong for the leader to be paid, but only after the party\u2019s finances have been sorted out. My message was simple. I will be the last one to get it. Today I am the only one who is not paid by the party.\nYou have been very vocal on the issue of foreign workers. Can you outline the PN\u2019s policy in this regard? Will the party limit the number of third country nationals entering Malta?\nWe will end up in a situation where 60,000 additional workers are be engaged by the private sector. What impact will this have on employment conditions? Many foreign workers are living in containers, getting a meagre pay, and spending nothing. We are using foreigners to build for foreigners. The country is not receiving any new tax revenue but just the social security contribution, as they are on the minimum wage.\nCan the Prime Minister tell us how many foreigners are needed to sustain every pension? What is the ratio? How many Turks at minimum wage are required for every 1,000 pensioners? How much does the country need to spend in order to upgrade its infrastructure to cater for this influx? Does it make sense financially?\u00a0\nJoseph Muscat has said he is leaving, and he is leaving a mess. He only planned for a few years, for 10 years. When the economy overheats the rich will get richer and the poor will get poorer.\nWhat are the PN\u2019s plans in this regard?\nChange cannot materialise overnight. There needs to be a gradual plan and this does not mean we do not want foreign workers. The government needs to shift certain economic priorities onto sectors like alternative energy, not fuel stations as it is currently happening.\nHas the government ever outlined the number of schools, hospitals or teachers required for the next decade? The PN will focus on the circular economy.\u00a0\u00a0\nHow do you plan to implement your pledge of guaranteeing accommodation for everybody? It sounds like a pre-election stunt.\nThe solution is either providing accommodation or lifting people out of poverty. However, there is a category who can never make it on their own except through social measures. We are not on the eve of the election and it is early days. I have three years to beef up my proposal.\nIs it a case of pledging now and seeing how to work it out later, or have you already got a clear idea of how to implement this ambitious proposal?\nWe have to make better use of government land, lift people out of poverty and it does not necessary imply dishing out apartments. We have to adapt to each and every circumstance.\u00a0\nHow will the PN make up for the revenue gap which will result if it halts the sale of passports?\nThe government is linking the sale of passports to social housing, to cleanse this filthy scheme. There are other ways to attract investment. Moreover, the impact on the real estate sector of the IIP is being blown out of proportion. Bed and breakfast tourists are having a much higher impact. I am against this scheme in principle. We need to plan to attract serious foreign investment, and the PN\u2019s track record in this respect is very good.\nUse of a differently-styled emblem in the ongoing general council has fuelled speculation that the PN could ditch its traditional \u2018maduma\u2019. Is this the case?\nNo such plan is in the pipeline.

In the wake of fake news about HIV transmission which was shared by a Maltese MP, he tells Ramona Depares that the country is in urgent need of basic education to remove the stigma.\nMalta lags far behind its European counterparts when it comes to educational campaigns about HIV, and the brunt is being borne by patients who are often at the receiving end of unjustified stigma, a young man who was diagnosed with HIV two years ago told this newspaper.\nThe man was reacting to recent reports on social media warning the public to beware of \u201cHIV infected\u201d fruit. The HIV virus can only be transmitted through specific body fluids that do not include saliva and tears.\n\u201cUnfortunately, there has been no nationwide educational campaign by the authorities to educate people about the realities of HIV and the ways it can be transmitted. This is one of the biggest reasons why HIV-positive people are treated as pariahs by many, as the majority actually believe that you can get the virus even through minimal contact like hugging,\u201d Adrian (not his real name) said.\nMoreover, Malta has failed to publicise a crucial medical breakthrough that would help considerably towards removing the stigma from many sufferers: in patients where the virus has become undetectable, it is not possible for them to transmit it to someone else.\n\u201cIn other words, not everyone who is HIV positive can transmit it to someone else. When the presence of the virus falls below a certain threshold over six months, it is impossible to transmit it. Thankfully, this is the case for me \u2013 I have responded well enough to the medication that I cannot infect anyone else,\u201d Adrian explains.\nThe US Centre for Disease Control currently defines undetectable as being when the presence of the virus is \u201cless than 200 copies/ml\u201d. The breakthrough, made official in 2016, was followed by major educational campaigns across Europe, using the tagline \u2018Undetectable Equals Untransmittable\u2019 \u2013 also referred to as U = U.\nBut Adrian laments that the Maltese government has, so far, failed to follow suit. This approach, he argues, is one of the main reasons why many Maltese remain clueless when it comes to safe interaction with HIV positive people. It is also why so many patients find themselves on the margins of society, afraid to interact with people for fear of the stigma raring its head.\nThe majority actually believe you can get the virus even through minimal contact like hugging\n\u201cWhen I was diagnosed HIV positive, it changed my life overnight. I was lucky enough to have a very strong support network of close friends and family, who coped with the news fantastically. But even so, there were many days when suicidal thoughts took over. I felt like damaged goods. If I did not have such a strong support system, I would not be here today. Not everyone is lucky to have that. Proper education would go a long way towards reducing these feelings of alienation,\u201d Adrian says.\nThe young man describes how there were days when he would abruptly stop what he was doing and burst into tears, staying in the foetal position for hours on end. Other days, he would simply \u201cfreak out\u201d.\n\u201cComing to terms with the news is a roller coaster of emotions, to put it mildly. You feel as though your body is not your own anymore, as though it has been taken over by something without your permission. It takes a long while to start accepting yourself again.\n\u201cThink how much worse people who spread unfounded myths \u2013 such as the idea that you can get HIV from a piece of fruit \u2013 make it for those who are suffering.\u201d\nAdrian\u2019s case is one of the rarer ones, in that he always used protection during sexual encounters. Medically, he had always been considered to be part of a low-risk group.\nFor a time after his diagnosis, he says, he was not sure he wanted to be alive, let alone go out and meet people. \u201cHow could I date someone and risk infecting them, too?\u201d he tells me earnestly.\nSince then Adrian has gone through all the steps of acceptance and coping, and leads a relatively normal life, the only glitches being the side-effects of the medication that occasionally manifest.\n\u201cI take my medication regularly and, thankfully, the virus is undetectable in me.\u201d\nMeantime, his one hope is not only to see a fully-blown educational campaign in order to minimise stigma and ease the pain of those who live with HIV, but to also have access to newer and more efficient medication, an area where Malta also lags behind.\n\u201cI am currently taking six pills a day, three every 12 hours. I have spoken to others who are in the same situation but who are living abroad \u2013 they take one pill a day, with barely any side effects. The medication we have in Malta wreaks havoc in your body, and keeping to a work routine can be tricky,\u201d he explains.\nHe confesses that he has been tempted to do like others, and order the more efficient medication online, but he has misgivings about how safe this would be.\n\u201cI really hope the government does something about it. We find so much money for so many things. This medication would improve the quality of life of a lot of people,\u201d he concludes.\n\u201cUntil this happens, the least that government can do is ensure proper education.

Dr Gambin plans to continue building on its success for future exhibitions.\nThe marine archaeologist hopes to see elements of these underwater findings become part of the national history curriculum, thus offering an interactive aspect to an academic subject which, he fears, is becoming increasingly unpopular.

Unfortunately, we are in a context where people don\u2019t distinguish between the person and the party especially in a small place like Malta, where you cannot just say that you want a personal discussion,\u201d Prof. Cassola said.\nWhen this happens, he said, parties should amend their policies, take these to members during the Annual General Meeting and only if they vote in favour of introducing them should these be taken up.\nAsked about his decision to contest the European Parliament elections as an independent candidate and whether he believed he had a chance of being elected, Prof. Cassola said that while he received \u201ca lot of positive feedback\u201d for sticking to what he believed in, he was also aware of the fact that in Malta such candidates did have not successful track records.\nHe insisted, however, that he wanted to \u201cbe there\u201d for those voters who were confused and who did not feel they could vote for either of the two main parties.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cThere is a big gap in Maltese politics at the moment and people are very confused, and this abortion issue might have confused them even more.\n\u201cThere is certainly a lot of confusion with people not sure who they identify with.

Six out of the seven walks prepared are moderate to hard. However, the first walk of the month, along and across the harbour, provides a good sport for beginners.\nHardy ramblers get more buzz from tougher, craggy stretches. The Gozo walk tops the en\u00addurance test. The hilly topography will perforce assess the stamina of ramblers as high ridges are climbed and deep valleys de\u00adscended many times over, during five hours of continuous walking.\nBesides the healthy exercise, the prize for the effort will be the breathtaking array of vistas on offer, rugged countryside and rocky coastline panoramas immersed in warm sunlight; sights that are not destined to last if the warped thinking behind the proposed Gozo tunnel continues.\nThe Ramblers are set against the idea of the two-lane tunnel for traffic because it is no solution at all for sensible connectivity between the islands. It is incredible how this idea, which has been bandied about for many years but discarded as unviable by different administrations, has been de\u00adclared as doable now without so much as a glance at its impacts and sustainability.\nHow presumptuous is it of our prime minister to summarily state that the tunnel is definitely going to be built and in the same breath say that scientific studies are yet to be concluded! This stinks of a foregone conclusion, with the studies being carried out as only ritual formalities. Rationally, one should wait for the studies before deciding.\nSupporters of the tunnel are ill informed if they think it is a quick solution for speeding up the crossing. Not only will it take years to complete but even once finished, it will not decrease the average crossing time appreciably. One must first consider the controls and collection of tolls. And the single-lane restriction will create delays in case of slow-moving vehicles and unimaginable problems in case of a breakdown or accident, which are inevitable.\nSeeing a tunnel for traffic as a solution is shortsighted\nQueues of tailing traffic will still remain but will be transferred elsewhere from M\u0121arr and \u010airkewwa. Since travel through the tunnel will be less staggered, more traffic will inevitably cause gridlocks in Gozo, given the size of the road network.\nThe sister island will become a mere extenion of characterless and polluted Malta as the building industry will irresistably thrive on covering green areas with cement, sadly eliminating bursts of countryside views as one drives along.\nThe distance travelled underground in a single lane will be at least three times the distance from M\u0121arr to \u010airkewwa.\nOne of the breathtaking array of Gozo sights.\nThe landscape beneath the Nadur ridge will be scarred as the gaping hole will pour its asphalt arteries onto the fertile meadows, causing irreversible damage to the environment.\nNor is it a long-term solution! Other problems will be caused by the traffic that is likely to escalate with long queues of vehicles puffing out poisonous exhaust (imagine being forced to stop in the middle of the tunnel!). One would have expected better thinking outside the box from the various authorities created recently to deal with traffic problems.\nOther measures that have been suggested, such as high-speed ferries, and ferries to different ports, need careful consideration in order to provide solutions that will hold for the next 50 or so years. A combination of such measures would certainly solve the problem of waiting time and queues. Seeing a tunnel for traffic as a solution is shortsighted.\nIf a tunnel has to be dug then let it be for a metro system that would remain underground and be studiously planned to encompass the whole of Malta, as has been suggested elsewhere.\nTogether with fiscal measures, it would have the effect of reducing traffic and improving air quality. It might be argued that tunnels for a metro system will aggravate the problem of waste. This is certainly true.\nHowever the Castille-inspired rhythm of overdevelopment, now described as \u201cthe great leap forward\u201d, knows no bounds and makes land reclamation inevi\u00adtable, with or without tunnels.\nSince Malta has to suffer the predicament for its purported progress, it is best to seek and suggest methods that limit the anticipated environmental damage.\nRamblers admiring the catacombs at Ta\u2019 Bistra in Mosta.\nMarch walks\nSunday, March 3: Around and across Marsamxett harbour \u2013 an easy cultural walk from Manoel Island to Valletta of some four hours taking in the Pinetum and Valletta gardens on the way, returning to the Ferries by boat.

The promotions, which took place in September 2013 included that of the present commander, Jeffrey Curmi, who had leapfrogged from major to brigadier \u2013 three levels of promotions \u2013 in a matter of months.\nThe Ombudsman, Dr de Marco noted, said the board's decision showed \"serious repercussions to democracy\".\n\"This is a serious accusation,\" the PN MP said. \"The authorities are not working. In our country, democracy is under threat,\" he added.\nDavid Agius.\nClosing off the general council, PN deputy leader David Agius said a PN government would see that justice was done with those who had not been promoted.\nHe also said a PN government would ensure a cleaner government, which worked against corruption and in favour of the environment.\u00a0\nDr Agius also made calls for unity, insisting the party needed to show the electorate it was united to gain people's trust", "comment_count": 52, "id": 1906}, {"keywords": "", "author": "Edwina Brincat", "article_body": "A man appealing an 18-month jail sentence was almost left without a legal leg to stand on because a court registrar had mistakenly logged his appeal as having been abandoned rather than adjourned.\u00a0\nJonathan Farrugia, who stands accused of being involved in the attempted bombing of a Fgura couple last year, had been found guilty of falsifying banknotes in 2016.\u00a0\nHe had appealed that decision, and a judge had ordered for an appeal hearing to be postponed to a later date as it clashed with another trial.\nBut the court registrar forget to log this, almost resulting in the appeal being thrown out.\nThe error was compounded when Mr Farrugia failed to put in an appearance, kickstarting a legal process whereby the appeal is deemed abandoned, which is what the registrar put down in the records of the case.\nBy the time the case was eventually heard, on February 19, 2019, the original judge had retired and the case was assigned to a different court, presided over by Madam Justice Consuelo Scerri Herrera.\nWhen\u00a0prosecuting lawyer Elaine Mercieca Rizzo, from the AG\u2019s Office, argued that the appeal had been abandoned and that the conviction had thus become final, the issue finally came to the fore.\u00a0\nBoth the appellant\u2019s lawyer, David Gatt, as well as inspector Malcolm Bondin, who had prosecuted before the Magistrates\u2019 Court, testified under oath that the appeal had never been abandoned but rather adjourned.\nThe court registrar was also summoned to testify on Thursday, admitting under oath that he had made a mistake and that the judge had ordered the case to be adjourned.\nThe registrar had informed both the prosecuting officer and the appellant\u2019s lawyer of the adjournment date, with printed copies of the relative e-mails being exhibited in court.\nIn the light of this evidence, Madam Justice Scerri Herrera observed that this had been \u201ca serious shortcoming by the Court registrar\u201d who had not only recorded the appeal as abandoned, but had even failed to cancel the appellant\u2019s admission ticket to jail, even though the appeal was still pending.\nThe Court pointed out that the accused would have ended serving his 18-month jail term even though submissions had not been made in his appeal.\nMadam Justice Scerri Herrera ordered the necessary corrections in the records of the case, while adjourning the appeal for continuation.", "comment_count": 2, "id": 1907}, {"keywords": "", "author": "", "article_body": "Bank of Valletta is re-activating its third-party payment services to areas outside the eurozone\u00a0from its branch network, and will endeavour to have them fully operational by Monday.\nThe bank is also working to reinstate these payments through internet banking.\nPayments within the eurozone were activated last week and are operational through all BOV channels in the normal manner.\nOver the past days, bank employees focused their efforts on restoring normal service, as well as on clearing up backlogs which accumulated due to a cyberattack on February 13 which saw \u20ac13m disappear from its systems.\nThe bank's operations are now close to normal.
