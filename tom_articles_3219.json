The current system started to be enforced gradually and last year the hospital collected up to \u20ac1.2 million in healthcare fees.\nThe funds are invested in the training of staff and hospital infrastructure. Last year, for example, the income helped fund part of Mater Dei\u2019s air conditioning project.\nMr Falzon explained that in the past people would head to hospital with a referral ticket from their GP and given an appointment without any questions asked. It was only when they turned up for their appointment that those not entitled to free healthcare would be asked to pay.\nThis was a \u2018lose-lose\u2019 situation that led to confrontation, ghost invoices with the consequent loss of revenue for the hospital, and in some cases the treatment slot was lost, he explained.\nTherefore, to make things easier, a new standard operating procedure started being rolled out in 2017. All new referrals now require documentation \u2013 such as payslip or marriage certificate \u2013 to be presented before an appointment is set up. Those who are not entitled to free treatment are informed of the fee upfront.\nThis system is still being rolled out across the different hospital departments, so not all patients are being informed as yet.\nMr Falzon noted that on average, 90 foreigners are seen at the emergency department and another 200 by the outpatients\u2019 services every day. Out of all these, between 60 and 70 people are sent to the billing department to prove their entitlement or otherwise, before they are seen by the professionals.\nForeigners need to present their payslip because so far there is no electronic system in place that checks the NI contributions of patients.\nMr Falzon said that the Health Ministry and the Family Ministry were working together on this issue, which has generated complaints from foreign patients.\n\u201cThe process we are aiming for is that rather than pushing data into the system, we pull data out of the system \u2013 for example we would input an NI number, and the system tells you whether you are entitled or not.\nRead: \u20ac2 million in unpaid bills fester at Mater Dei\n\u201cAt the moment we are asking patients to show us their payslip, pulling the information from the patient. It should be the other way round.\u201d\nThe end result will either be a database with updated information about NI contributions, or an entitlement card issued together with the work permit for those without a Maltese ID card or a Reciprocal Health Agreement card.\nDirector of the Entitlement Unit Michelle Galea, from the Ministry for Health, noted that the current social security data was around a year old, and that is why people were being asked to present their most recent payslip dating to the previous month.\nFollowing an exercise in 2015, Mater Dei realised that a potential \u20ac1.5 to \u20ac2 million in services were being given to non-entitled patients every year.

In such cases, questions were asked first and people treated once those questions have been answered, he added.\nWhat if you do not want to leave your payslip with the billing department?\nRevenue Manager Steve Ellul said patients had a right not to leave the payslip with the clerk because of data protection issues. In such cases, the staff had been instructed to contact him for approval and verify that they have seen the NI contribution document. He admitted the need for more fine-tuning of the system.\nThe patients\u2019 experience\u2026\n\u25aa A woman with Italian citizenship, dependent on her partner who pays NI in Malta, was rushed to Mater Dei by ambulance, where she was admitted for pneumonia-related complications. At the hospital she was reassured that she was entitled to free healthcare but she then received a \u20ac2,500 bill at home.\n\u25aa A Scottish man was asked for his payslip upon being admitted to emergency and asked to send it by e-mail as soon as he could, even though he was in pain. He questioned whether people were expected to carry their payslip around with them.\n\u25aa When a British woman turned up for an appointment, she was asked on the spot to present a payslip. When she did not want to leave her payslip with the billing department because of privacy, she was asked for a marriage certificate and her son\u2019s birth certificate as he was the patient.

Photo: Matthew Mirabelli\nThe villa is one of the nation\u2019s oldest country houses of the nobility, with strong stylistic affinities with the scheduled Inquisitor\u2019s Palace in Girgenti and Palazzo Gomerino in Rabat. The early 17th-century walled gardens boast several impressive architectural features, including a unique two-storey-high prospettiva [pavilion], dated 1625, and are frequently visited by the Royal Horticultural Society.\nThe context of the villa would be irrevocably destroyed\nThe villa\u2019s important heritage value was already recognised back in the 1920s when it was placed on the list of protected monu\u00adments by the museum authorities. This status was affirmed by the Planning Authority in 1996 when it scheduled the house with the highest level of protection, and the garden in 2009, creating a buffer zone. This has, however, proven to be inadequate.\nThe Marquis said it was an exception in Malta to be fighting for the scheduling of one\u2019s own property, because owners usually wanted to leave open the possibility of selling it for development.\nThe recent application was \u201ca direct result of the authority\u2019s deplorable failure to properly enforce the villa\u2019s scheduled protection, and the horrific impact on the villa\u2019s garden fa\u00e7ade is all too evident in the photomontage.\nPointing out an encouraging development in the ongoing saga, he said the Authority had, as instructed by the Environment and Planning Review Tribunal, commissioned a sighting report with a view to extending the buffer zone.\nThe appointed expert had submitted the report recommending the inclusion of the area opposite the villa\u2019s fa\u00e7ade (including the proposed development) within the two-storey buffer zone, and the Marquis now expected the authority to \u201cfinally see sense and comply with its own commissioned report\u201d, which is currently before the tribunal.\nAlthough he remained in limbo because no action has been taken on the report, which would save the house if implemented, he was also confident that, with the backing of the Superintendence of Cultural Heritage, the authority would not allow the villa to be \u201creduced to nothing but a panorama for the towering blocks threatening to surround it, while the views and context of the villa and gardens themselves, from within the heritage property, would be irrevocably destroyed\u201d.\nAs the authority charged with safeguarding the nation\u2019s built heritage, Marquis Cremona Barbaro said it was expected to translate words into concrete action and show the nation it was truly committed to protecting its patrimony. \u201cA Grade 1 scheduling is not a mere paper exercise,\u201d he insisted.\n\u201cI am the guardian of another Grade 1 scheduled heritage building and it cannot be mere coincidence that they are both gravely threatened by encroaching development,\u201d\u00a0he pointed out, referring to Villa Barbaro Bellosguardo in Attard, which housed a renowned private museum in the 18th century.\nThis was also facing the threat of a \u201cdisfiguring\u201d four-metre-high development directly on the scheduled garden walls, as well as a bedroom just behind its baroque prospettiva.\n\u201cAll this can only be a reflection of the serious and disturbing crisis our built heritage is currently facing. Grade 1 scheduled buildings are described by the Planning Authority itself as having outstanding architectural or historical interest that should be preserved in their entirety and that no alterations impairing the setting would be allowed.\n\u201cThe measure of a country\u2019s maturity and self-worth is in the extent to which it cherishes and respects its past and particularly the cultural heritage handed down by past generations. But if it wilfully turns its back on its past and stands by the wayside while the most splendid relics are systematically eradi\u00adcated, it condemns itself to a very bleak future,\u201d the Marquis concluded. \u201cIt becomes a nation without a soul.\u201d \u00a0", "comment_count": 45, "id": 3831}, {"keywords": "", "author": "", "article_body": "A man and a woman were seriously injured on Sunday afternoon when an argument involving seven people got out of hand.\nThe police said they were informed of the situation in Villabate Street, Zabbar, at 4pm.\nOfficers from the local police station and the Rapid Intervention Unit were deployed to calm the situation.\nThe argument involved a 26-year-old woman and a 20-year-old man from Cospicua, a 43-year-old woman from Vittoriosa, a 23-year-old man and a 53-year-old woman from\u00a0 Zabbar, a 24-year-old woman from Qormi, and a 46 year old man, whose home town was not immediately known.\nThe injured were the 46-year-old man and the 26-year-old woman, who are being treated at Mater Dei Hospital.\u00a0\nIt is understood that no weapons were used.\u00a0", "comment_count": 0, "id": 3832}, {"keywords": "", "author": "", "article_body": "A paraglider was lucky to escape injury on Sunday afternoon when he crashed into the cliff face at Mta\u0127leb.\nThe man ended up dangling from the chute which was stuck to the rocks, but he was pulled up safely by a team from the Civil Protection Department.\u00a0", "comment_count": 10, "id": 3833}, {"keywords": "", "author": "", "article_body": "Arnold Cassola has resigned from Alternattiva Demokratika, a party which he co-founded and led for several years, amid differences over the topic of abortion.\nHe told Times of Malta, however, that he will contest the European Parliament elections as an independent candidate.\nIn a letter to chairperson Carmel Cacopardo, Prof Cassola said that there were clearly differences between him and the party's executive over abortion.\nHe said he was strongly against abortion except where the life and health of the mother were in danger.\nOn Friday, AD's MEP candidate Mina Tolu said that political parties' refusal to discuss abortion and reproductive rights was \"frightening and unacceptable\".\nProf. Cassola had called on the party to dissociate itself from her comments and to reaffirm a position against abortion.

But the trend does not spell good news for residents.\nIt\u2019s gone midnight in the sleepy town of Lija and the streets leading to the village core are devoid of life. So far, so typical of a Friday night in your average Maltese village.\nBut first appearances can be deceptive and, upon turning a specific corner, the scene changes drastically.\nThe change can be heard before it is seen \u2013 a loud \u2018murmuring\u2019 that, as it turns out, emanates from a sizeable group of people who are enjoying a drink and a smoke outside the doors of a particular village bar. Their chatter is punctuated by the grating noise of distorted bass that can be heard through the open entrance doors.\nThe effect is devastating to anyone whose home lies adjacent to the bar, as window panes and the old stonework react to the sudden blasts.\nThe bar is located bang in the middle of what is supposed to be one of the quietest residential areas of Malta. A description that ceases to apply every Friday and Saturday night from 8pm up till the early hours of the morning.\nAnd it is a scene that repeats itself across an increasing number of residential localities and village cores, as scores of revellers descend on what were once quiet bars to let their hair down. Mosta, G\u017cira, Naxxar, Lija, Floriana, Dingli, Rabat and Qormi are only a few of the localities that boast a busy \u2018nightlife\u2019.\nFrom band clubs to political clubs, they seem to have eagerly jumped on the latest entertainment cash cow, with some even going so far as to \u2018rebrand\u2019 with catchier names and flashy signage.\nUnder current legislation, any tourist establishment wishing to play amplified music requires a specific permit from the Malta Tourism Authority. Even then, if the music can be heard from outdoors, it must be stopped by 11pm.\nHowever, band clubs and politi\u00adcal party clubs are not caught under this regulation, as they are registered as \u2018social clubs\u2019 under subsidiary legislation that makes no reference to excessive noise or amplified music.\nThe same legislation does lay down that the club cannot cause annoyance to neighbours, under pain of possible closure. But, judging by the reports that keep coming in from various localities, it is clear there is no strict enforcement of this particular law.\nThe resurgence of village bars \u2013 and with it, the problem of noise pollution in residential areas \u2013\u00a0 is a relatively recent phenomenon. Michael, a 38-year-old who somewhat sheepishly admits to being a regular at evenings that are known as a \u2018ka\u017cinata\u2019, puts this popularity down to that holy tri\u00adnity of a great night out \u2013 cheap drinks, free appetizers and relatively easy parking.\n\u201cUp till a couple of years ago, the trend was to go to a wine-bar for our regular outings. But that can be expensive and, let\u2019s face it, it\u2019s not the ideal scenario if you\u2019re single,\u201d he says.\nYou only go to Paceville if you\u2019re a tourist or a teenager. Or if you\u2019re into sex clubs\nBugibba, St Julian\u2019s and Pace\u00adville hold few attractions for those who are after regular weekends out. \u201cYou only go to Paceville if you\u2019re a tourist or a teenager.

A round for six sets you back less than a tenner. Try doing that at a fancy bar in Bu\u0121ibba.\nHowever, it\u2019s not just about cheap drinks.\n\u201cI think we stuck to these places because they offer a lively night out while being chill at the same time. The vibe is totally different to other lounge bars. Everyone seems to be friendlier, strangers will pick up a conversation and will do so without being creepy. And it\u2019s only at ka\u017cini that I have seen a 70-year-old grandpa dancing to Despacito,\u201d he tells me with a grin.\nBut not everyone is as enthused with this new trend on the entertainment front.

As of recently, it\u2019s become a bit of a nightmare. Every weekend I can feel the music vibrating through my house.

Drunken people conversing \u201canimatedly\u201d in the street has become a common sight.\nAnnemarie says she has made \u201cseveral\u201d reports to the police but that these led nowhere.\nOne bar operator in her locality claimed he had never received any complaints from the police or the council. And, while admitting to playing music on the premises, he insisted that this could not be heard from outside.\nAnother problem is that the practice of leasing out the bar operation to a third party means the club\u2019s committee is not always aware of what exactly is happening.\n\u201cI have never received any complaints but I\u2019m not sure exactly what events the bar operator is holding,\u201d the president of another club admitted when contacted. \u201cI will certainly be following up on this matter, and carrying out spot checks over the weekend.\u201d\nJohn Fenech, from the Noise Abatement Society of Malta, shares residents\u2019 concerns, adding that the society has received several complaints from various localities about the issue.\n\u201cUnfortunately, although there are regulations regarding music being played at particular outlets, it is difficult to make sure they are enforced,\u201d he says.\nThe law lays down fines for those who are found to be in breach of their permits.

The founders of IB were looking for a programme of studies that, educational excellence apart, promoted peace in what was then a turbulent Cold War world. The programme was subsequently refined by Oxford University to promote critical thinking skills. Today IB aims at encouraging students across the world to become active, compassionate and lifelong learners who understand that other people, with their differences, can also be right.\nFifty years down the line, IB has consultative status as a non-governmental organisation at the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (Unesco), with the IB Diploma (IBDP) recognised by universities around the world as an outstanding, leading university admissions qualification.\nAccording to Howard Gardner, a professor of educational psychology at Harvard University, IBDP helps students \u201cthink criti\u00adcally, synthesise knowledge, reflect on their own thought processes and get their feet wet in interdisciplinary thinking\u201d.\nStudies by a number of universities have shown clearly that IBDP graduates are not only more likely to join university, indeed a top university, but importantly, are more likely to complete the course of their choice with success and a higher grade.\nThey are also more likely than peers following other university entrance curricula to be granted scholarships. This is probably largely due to the well-established fact that IBDP students join university better trained in academic research, writing skills and with a capacity to prioritise and organise their studies. A major component of the IBDP is the Extended Essay, a mandatory research paper of up to 4,000 words.\nInterestingly, accordingly to a 2013 study, in China, which is heavily dependent on higher education for its economic development, 72 per cent of students taking IBPD attended one of the world\u2019s top universities. Research commissioned by the UK\u2019s Higher Statistics Agency (HESA) established that IBDP students have a 57 per cent greater likelihood of being accepted by one of the top 20 UK universities. IBDP is now held in such high regard that a good number of top universities have substantially lowered admission levels for IBDP students.\nEducation is not only about obtaining good grades, ultimately on a global level, it is there to create a better and more peaceful world, which takes us back to the founding fathers of IB. On an individual basis, education is about preparing for life. The HESA survey has shown that post-university, IBDP students on average earn more than their peers.\nMark Seldon, director of studies at Gresham School, UK, an advocate of IB, commented: \u201cThe IB encourages the soft skills that business value \u2013 things like teamwork, communication and empathy.\u201d Increasingly, in today\u2019s globalised world, employers want young people to think more globally.\nIB teachers are an integral part of this success story. In order to teach IB, teachers must attend, on a regular basis, high-quality professional development workshops, more often than not at IB regional centres, as well as keeping up with advances via specifically designed online workshops. There is certainly no room for complacency for IB teachers, what they teach today, and how they teach it, is not what they will be doing tomorrow.\nAn essential element of IBDP is the structured Creativity, Activity and Service (CAS) programme. This ensures that students involve themselves in creative thinking, a healthy lifestyle complementing academic work, and finally at the root of it all, unpaid, voluntary community work.\nFundamental to all this is that no points are awarded for CAS in the final IBDP grade, a true lesion in altruism. However, in the end, students get out of it far more than they put into it. In research studies, business leaders have commented on the project management skills of IBDP students, their work ethic, their open mindedness and level of self-confidence.\nIn this village we still call the world, there is a growing demand for an international curriculum-based education. St Edward\u2019s College is one of the ever-increasing number of IB World Schools, currently 4,871 in 153 countries across all five continents. IB accreditation is not only a rigorous process, it is also an ongoing process subject to periodic review.\nYear in, year out, since obtaining IB accreditation in 2009, St Edward\u2019s IB pass rate has been above the world average. St Edward\u2019s IBDP graduates continue to be admitted to the University of Malta as well as leading universities worldwide, including the London School of Economics, Imperial College, London, UCLA in the US, McGill in Canada, Bocconi in Milan, the Medical University of Gdansk, Poland, LUISS Business School in Rome, and Groningen in The Netherlands and Berlin.\nEqually important is the feedback the college has received as a result of its CAS programme. For example, students learn and carry for their lifetime the satisfaction of mornings spent with the less fortunate at the Appo\u0121\u0121 summer school in Cospicua, a lesion from the big wide world that no amount of academic input can substitute.\nSt Edward\u2019s College offers home from home boarding facili\u00adties.

The trend on all ratings is stable.\nDBRS said it based its considerations on the fact that economic momentum remained strong, with gross domestic product (GDP) growth accelerating to 7.5% year over year in last year\u2019s third quarter.\nThe Central Bank of Malta\u2019s latest estimates pointed to full year growth at 5.9% in 2018.\nDBRS expected GDP growth to decelerate gradually but to remain high in years to come, especially when compared with its European peers.\nBenefiting from tax-rich economic growth, fuelled by domestic demand, strong job creation, and the impulse from its International Investment Programme (IIP), the CBM estimated Malta\u2019s fiscal surplus stood at 2.1% of GDP in 2018.\nAgainst this backdrop, the Maltese government\u2019s debt-to-GDP ratio could drop to 45% in 2018, according to the CBM. DBRS expected the debt ratio to continue to decline related to the primary surplus and the favourable debt snowball effect.\nThe rating confirmation reflected DBRS\u2019s view that despite the upward pressure from improving economic and public finance metrics, Malta\u2019s structural challenges continued to constrain the ratings.\nGiven the size and openness of the economy, external developments, including international corporate taxation or regulatory changes, could negatively affect economic and fiscal variables.\nMalta\u2019s A (high) rating was supported by its euro zone membership, strong external position, low reliance on external financing, favourable public debt structure, and households\u2019 strong financial position.\nHowever, Malta\u2019s contingent liabilities, stemming from its large state-owned enterprises and concentrated financial sector, and rising age-related costs are potential sources of vulnerability for public finances. Malta\u2019s small and open economy exposed the country to external developments.\nDBRS said the Stable trend reflected its opinion that further upgrades were unlikely in the absence of:\n(1) a sustained material reduction in the public debt ratio to low levels driven by sound fiscal management and economic performance; or\n(2) further evidence of increased economic and fiscal resiliency to external shocks, including changes to the international tax or regulatory environment.\nWhile DBRS\u2019s baseline factored in a relatively positive economic and fiscal outlook, a deterioration in the trajectory for public debt in the medium term could exert downward pressure on Malta\u2019s ratings.\nThis could derive from:(1) a deterioration in growth prospects,(2) sustained worsening of fiscal and debt indicators, or(3) the materialisation of contingent liabilities.\nRating rationale\nMalta continued to outperform EU average growth rates with broad-based expansion\nRecent economic performance, DBRS said, had been remarkable, with 7.2% annual average\nGDP growth from 2013 to 2017, was well above the 2.1% average rate between 2004 and 2012.\nIn this context, Malta\u2019s GDP per capita (\u20ac24,984) continued to converge to EU average levels (\u20ac30,946) in 2018, as per EC estimates.\nGrowth was broad-based with outward-facing sectors such as tourism, gaming, financial and business services being key contributors to Malta\u2019s outperformance.\nA highly elastic foreign labour supply, increased labour participation rates, and a rising share of less capital-intensive service sectors prevented overheating pressures. According to EC estimates, potential GDP growth jumped from 2.5% from 2004 to 2012 to 6% from 2013 to 2018.\nThe International Monetary Fund\u2019s projected an annual average GDP growth rate of 3.8% between 2019 and 2022.\nStrong domestic demand, as well as supply factors, would continue to support growth in Malta. Higher investment, increased labour supply, and enduring benefits from the energy reform would continue to buttress potential output.\nAddressing emerging infrastructure bottlenecks and labour shortages in certain sectors, which could weigh increasingly on growth, would remain a challenge.Malta\u2019s open economy was the smallest in the euro area and was vulnerable to weak external demand and lower foreign direct investment.\nOn the other hand, the private and public-sector reliance on domestic funding reduced the risks from financial markets contagion. In the short term, major risks stemmed from an escalation of protectionist trade measures hurting global trade and growth as well as the impact on tourism from Brexit.\nIn the medium term, changes in international corporate taxation could to some degree diminish the attractiveness of Malta for multinational companies.

However, rather than bore through the rock along an estimated 14-kilometre route, from l-Imbordin to Nadur, as the government is proposing, the immersed tunnel technology would only require the excavation of an 80-metre wide passage along the underwater route to make way for the prefabricated tunnel units.\u00a0\nOnce the entire structure is formed, it is covered with the same material unearthed during excavation, thus doing away with the need of having to dispose large volumes of rock elsewhere.\nThe spokesman said studies on how to rehabilitate the seabed were done and they would also make use of technology to mitigate pollution. Feedback from the Environment Resources Authority would be sought, he pledged. Seven possible routes were identified and, in all cases, the exits would be very close to the shore as the tunnel would not be as deep as if it had to be excavated under the seabed, he added.\nExcavation and labour expenses would be lower than if boring through rock, however, the spokesman would not say how much the project would cost.\u00a0\n\u201cOur proposal will probably cost less than the government\u2019s proposal but at this stage we cannot give any figures,\u201d he said.\n\u201cUnlike the government\u2019s proposal, our project will have four and not two lanes.

quality of the show, possibly reflecting \u201cthe unhappy state of public media in general\u201d.\nPatrick Cassar, a former police sergeant stationed at the RIU with 23 years of experience and a shooting instructor specially trained in VIP protection, had filed libel proceedings after David Thake read an email in June 2016 in the course of his daily programme which used to be aired on Radio 101.\nThe contents of that email, allegedly sent by a follower of the programme, had lamented certain irregularities within the police force and claimed that the applicant, identified by his rank and number, was a \"taghna lkoll\" member who lacked knowledge but considered himself as good as some Navy Seal or a Special Forces Operator.\nThe contents of the email were read out in full by the programme presenter, Mr Thake, whose line of defence, when summoned to defend himself against the allegations of libel, was that \u201cwhen a person called the station, I could not censor anyone,\u201d adding that he always used to read out \u201cevery letter that was received\u201d.\nWhen questioned about the contents of that particular programme, the presenter could not confirm the transcript of the show, claiming that since he used to host the daily show for some two-and-a-half years, he had difficulty recalling the \u201cthe contents of each show\u201d.\nWhen delivering judgment, the court, presided over by magistrate Francesco Depasquale, observed that Mr Thake had made no effort to verify the allegations made in the email, nor did he produce the sender of that letter to testify in the case, choosing instead to read it out in full.\nMoreover, this had not been a case of a live on-air call, but one in which the presenter had read out an email which he had received earlier on and which he could have sought to verify beforehand, the court observed.\nOn the basis of evidence put forward, it resulted that the allegations made in the email regarding Mr Cassar\u2019s lack of qualifications, had been unfounded, since the former police officer had obtained training both locally as well as abroad, even in the US, over a long number of years.\nHe had even received special mention by foreign officials over his involvement in security handling during the 2015 CHOGM events in Malta.\nWhile upholding the libel claims, the court regretfully observed that \u201cwe are living in a society where as a rule a public person is indiscriminately attacked\u2026 under the pretext of freedom of expression,\u201d in a scenario where the media are being used as \u201cdivisive instruments to instill envy rather than to provide information and enhance education\u201d.\nThe court also highlighted the \u201cpoor and unethical\u201d handling of the show, a possible reflection of the \u201cunhappy state of public media in general,\u201d where the right to freedom of expression was being abused.\nWhile declaring Karl Gouder as non-suited, given that it had not been proved that he had been registered editor of Radio 101 at the time, the court ordered Mr Thake to pay \u20ac3,000 in damages.\nDr Alfred Abela was counsel to Mr Cassar.", "comment_count":
