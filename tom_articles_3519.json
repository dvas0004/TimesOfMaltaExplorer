Last month, this newspaper reported on concerns, raised by residents, that ancient archaeological remains have been cleared away during works to pave a ramp off Triq Sant\u2019Ursola in Victoria.\nIn a brief statement, the Ministry for Gozo told The Sunday Times of Malta that \u201cworks on the Gozo Museum are proceeding to schedule and the new revelations will be incorporated with the revised designs\u201d.\nThe ministry noted also that the findings are subject to further investigations.\nThe brand new landmark is expected to incorporate a \u201cmulti-disciplinary regional museum and cultural centre\u201d showcasing specimens and exemplars related to natural history, folklore and archaeology.\nThis depository is expected to group under one roof several State collections among them one bringing together works of art as currently there is no such collection on the sister island.\nAround \u20ac3.7 million have been earmarked for this initiative which is being is co-financed by the European Development Fund.\nHistorical fact\n\u201cIn the course of time, the prosperity of Carthage gave umbrage to Rome who challenged and broke the supremacy of her great rival in the Punic Wars between 264-146BC. Livy relates that after the victory of the Roman fleet over the Carthaginians at Lilybaeum (Marsala), the Consul Titus Sempronius sailed to Malta where Hamilcar surrendered to him with about 2,000 men. This is the only record left by a Latin writer of the annexation of Malta to the Roman Empire.\n\u201cIt would appear that the Maltese were granted an autonomous government with the privilege of sending ambassadors to Rome to plead their cases when necessary, and later, the island was made a Municipium\u2026\n\u201cIt does not seem probable that a numerous Roman colony did ever settle in Malta, not only because the Romans rarely attempted to colonise the countries they conquered but also because Malta had no other attractions but its harbours.\u201d\nSource: Themistocles Zammit in Malta The Maltese Islands and their History.

A leaked e-mail from the Panama law firm Mossack Fonseca said 17 Black was going to pay up to $2 million into Panama companies formerly owned by the Prime Minister\u2019s chief of staff Keith Schembri and Tourism Minister Konrad Mizzi.\nElectrogas received revenues of \u20ac36 million for gas supply and \u20ac93.3 million for electricity it supplied to Enemalta during its first full year of operation. It declared a loss of \u20ac23 million in 2017.\nThe role of Azerbaijan\u2019s State-owned energy company as an LNG supplier to Electrogas has raised eyebrows, not least because Socar Trading SA does not have its own LNG supply chain.\nInstead, it buys LNG from suppliers like Shell, then sells it on to Electrogas at a fixed price. The same LNG is then sold on to Enemalta as part of a 10-year contract.\nReluctance to disclose any details about the Socar Trading SA deal is also evident in leaked e-mails and documents from Electrogas. These documents were leaked to slain journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia a few months before her death and later acquired by the Daphne Project.

Photo: Kris Micallef\nSocial media platforms across Malta were united in tribute to the fashion icon, who was one of the first openly transgender public personas on the island at a time when there was not much awareness about LGBTQI issues.\nThe model was hailed by those who knew her as an inspiration and a source of strength even for the current generation of gay activisits.\nJames Mifsud, one of her closest friends, describes how she \u201cmetaphorically laid down the red carpet for today\u2019s LGBTQ scene to be able to safely come out and live their lives\u201d.\nThe two met by chance in the 1990s, at the City of London bar, a favourite hangout of both.\n\u201cI had already spotted her a couple of times before actually meeting her. I couldn\u2019t help wonder who this glamorous woman, who looked like a James Bond star, was,\u201d he reminisced.\nAfter that first meeting, the two became firm friends and would hang out together.\n\u201cHer stories were something else. She had left Malta aged 17, simply so that she could be herself. And, in London, she managed. She modelled, she hung out with stars, she lived a fabulous life,\u201d Mr Mifsud says.\nKatya was, in fact, known for having starred on Vogue and a number of other international magazines in the 1980s, as well as for the star-studded company she kept.\n\u201cShe\u2019d hang out with David Bowie, Mick Jagger... the stories I\u2019ve heard are amazing.\u201d\nEventually, Katya returned to Malta, where she is widely credited with starting the LGBTQ scene.\n\u201cThis was back in the days where there wasn\u2019t a gay scene in Malta. It was before the days of Gay Pride. I remember, once, we dressed up in costumes and paraded through Paceville, with Katya leading the d\u00e9fil\u00e9 . We wanted to tell everyone that we are here, we exist.\u201d\nShe\u2019d hang out with David Bowie, Mick Jagger... the stories I\u2019ve heard are amazing\nBut, beyond the flamboyance and eccentricity, Mr Mifsud also remembers Katya\u2019s \u201cheart of gold\u201d. \u201cShe never gave up on anything. She was always smiling, and she always looked impeccable, no matter her mood. Her style was very Alexander McQueen. Though, sometimes, she\u2019d also bring to mind Audrey Hepburn, with her classic taste and perfect grooming, especially walking down Republic Street in Valletta, with those big sunglasses of hers.\u201d\nHis parting words are poignant as they are heartfelt.\nA picture of Katya as a young model.\n\u201cShe was the foundation of the LGBTQ community in Malta. She is their queen, without even knowing.\u201d\nWords that are echoed by Keith St John, one of the regular DJs at Lollipop parties, possibly the biggest recurring event on the local gay scene.\nHe describes how he had \u201cheard the stories\u201d about her before even meeting her, which had always made him wonder why everyone spoke so highly of her.\n\u201cWhen I met her, it all made sense. The woman had a strong presence and energy. Yet, she was so kind, not to mention witty. Kaka, as we knew her, is one of those people we should be grateful for, because she was a warrior during a more conservative time,\u201d he says.\nThe camera never stopped loving her, as a recent series of portraits by Maltese photographer Kris Micallef reveals.\nMr Micallef recalls seeing her for the first time back when he was a little boy.\n\u201cI was struck by her aura.

But studies cited in your own reports show that new roads quickly fill up with displaced or induced traffic. Are we going to spend all this money only to end up in the same situation we are in now?\nThe complex challenges we are facing with our roads did not start yesterday. There is no single solution. I do not think it is true that widening roads just brings more cars. The Central Link studies showed that if nothing is done, we are approaching gridlock.\nI would have loved, when I took over this portfolio, to find a fully-fledged underground system, public transport capable of carrying 70 million passengers, and therefore less need for people to own their own private vehicles. But the situation was different.\nWe have to solve the problems people are facing now, but we had 78 new cars added to the road every day in 2018. How are you going to address that?\nThe way to do that is positive measures to encourage people to use other means of transport. If you have 26,000 young people using buses for free, that means they are not using their cars. Some of those may have used the buses anyway, but many of them would probably already have got cars.\nWe have no plans to introduce measures stopping people from getting their own cars, but we want to offer alternatives. At the same time, certain bottlenecks have to be addressed.\nThe Central Link study showed that without the project, we will be facing total gridlock. But even with the project, traffic times still will not go down if the growth in cars remains the same.\nThat is where we have to be intelligent. I criticised the situation we found: no alternative transport solutions and a culture of private car use.\nWe are winning ourselves some time by solving the bottlenecks. In parallel, we will be taking decisions to ensure that by that time we will have people choosing alternative transport.\nIs it worth the cost \u2013 in terms of money and in many cases agricultural land \u2013 for what is a short-term fix?\nThese decisions are never easy, but they are not taken lightly. The Central Link project has been on the cards since the 1980s. In 2006, under a Nationalist administration, the authorities concluded again that it had to take place. Against that, you have a group of residents who have always lobbied successfully. That does not work with me. I take decisions.\nThe project will happen, not just for the good of the people passing from there, but for the good of Attard, Balzan, Lija and Iklin, towns where narrow roads are constantly blocked with people trying to avoid congestion on the main road. I am not happy that fields need to be taken up, but because the road has not yet been built, other areas have been destroyed.\u00a0\nAre you happy with the efficiency of the public transport system right now?\nI am tempted to say I am happy, it should always improve because public transport users are the ones truly helping the situation, not the keyboard warriors getting angry at the minister for uprooting a tree.\nHow can you expect the most obese nation in Europe to cycle in 35 degree weather?\nOur numbers show that reliability has got better. We now have to look at capacity, where we have become victims of our own success. Today people are not complaining about the bus not showing up, they are complaining about it being full.\u00a0\nHow actively are you working on this?\nI have asked Transport Malta to carry out an exercise on optimisation and to establish where we need additional capacity. I expect that when we increase capacity we are going to be criticised for increasing subsidies, but when you see the \u20ac30 million we pay for an efficient public transport system, it is relatively small compared to the investment in infrastructure.\nCycling advocates have repeatedly raised the problem of lack of infrastructure. Should this be more of a priority?\nI do not think the criticism is always valid, especially as there have been projects where we are criticised for increasing cycle lines: a 1.5-metre stretch along several kilometres is what then leads journalists to say we have taken up another football pitch of agricultural land.\nI think it is also important that we realise not everyone is ready or able to travel by bike. We should help the portion of the population willing to do so, but we cannot fool ourselves into thinking Malta will ever be Amsterdam. We are not Amsterdam, in climate, culture or geography. How can you expect the most obese nation in Europe to cycle in 35 degree weather?\nDo you not think that simply repeating these limitations is just keeping us where we are?\nThese are facts. If you live and work in Pembroke and St Julian\u2019s, then yes, we should be making it easier for you. But for someone from Mellie\u0127a who works at Smart City, it just does not make sense.\nWe are going to invest in two cycling routes: one from Mosta to Mater Dei and the University, and another from St Julian\u2019s to Valletta. But it is a difficult balance and one section of road users cannot expect the government to discard other methods of transport to focus on theirs.\nYou have implemented several incentive schemes for electric vehicles but there has been nearly no take-up. Do you have any hope this will increase?\nI think it is like smartphones: other than a few early adopters, people are waiting for the technology to improve. A car is a major investment and people are waiting for the product to get better and cheaper. We cannot offer any more generous incentives, although the time will come when we say you cannot import any more diesel and petrol cars.\nIs a phase-out within the next 20 years, as has been suggested, feasible?\nI am told the product is expected to get much better in the coming months and years so I expect people to make that choice of their own accord. What is certain is that when the industry sees governments no longer permitting importation of petrol and diesel cars, they will be speeding up the development of their product.\n\u201cCertain bottlenecks have to be addressed.\u201d Photo: Jonathan Borg\nYou are also responsible for planning. Last year, the Planning Authority approved 13,000 new dwellings, more than ever before. People are looking at that and saying it\u2019s a free-for-all.\nPeople applied for those permits.\nAre too many being approved?\nThis is a country that is growing. We\u2019ve made choices as a country. Today we don\u2019t want to do certain types of work; Maltese people no longer aspire to clean the streets, or to work in construction, or bars and restaurants\u2026\nThere is obviously a construction boom but should the PA be managing or restricting it further?\nCan we agree that we are working with Local Plans from 2006? These are the effects of the Local Plans from 2006.\nSo why don\u2019t we have new ones?\nThey are being worked on. Those Local Plans should be allowed to develop and mature because at the end of the day they also gave new rights to landowners and property owners.\nI think we need to be looking at higher quality projects. This country can take more growth, but it cannot take more low-quality projects. There is space for growth because there is demand for growth. More people are buying homes, more people are investing in property, more people are living and working in Malta. But we need to significantly improve quality.\nAs you said, we are still working on 2006 local plans. Why have the new plans been delayed so long?\nThere was an inundation of submissions. The 2006 exercise saw an area the size of Si\u0121\u0121iewi added to the development zone. I would prefer to do nothing than to do that sort of exercise.\nThis exercise has to be driven by the needs of the country. We need to see how many schools, hospitals, roads, hotels, public spaces, parks, retirement homes we need. This is not something you can do quickly.\nCan you put any timeline on it? This legislature?\nThat would be presumptuous. When it happens it should happen well.\nWithout the local plans, without a masterplan for places like Paceville, it feels like there is no long-term planning. We are seeing major projects all taking place without a holistic vision.\nIn Paceville, we have known for a long time that it was designated for the sort of projects we are seeing. What we need, and Transport Malta is working on it, is a transport plan. I am sure Enemalta and Water Services are doing their homework too.\nSo are you not worried about the consequences of assessing projects one at a time?\nI understand that somebody who suddenly finds themselves living next to a construction site will be upset, but the country has chosen to grow\nIt is happening within the framework of the existing policies. When the PA issued its thoughts on the Paceville masterplan there was not enough engagement with the community and we know how that ended up. Perhaps the public also is not ready for certain difficult decisions.\nOn a lot of major projects, thousands of objectors, NGOs, local councils will all say their concerns are being ignored. Is the planning process helping the ordinary citizen or only the big developers?\nI think the numbers you quoted earlier show that families who want to build or change their home are finding the planning process a help not a hindrance. Obviously someone who has a development happening next door to them will object. But people object for many reasons, even to small projects, and we cannot have a situation where everyone gets their way just because they object.\nWhen you have such a mass of people, even local councils, shouldn\u2019t that carry some weight?\nWe have given local councils a vote on major projects, and we have seen projects, including tall buildings, that were not approved.\nI understand that somebody who suddenly finds themselves living next to a construction site will be upset, but the country has chosen to grow. People do not want to go back to how they were in 2008.\nDo you worry that quality of life is going backwards even as the economy grows?\nI think there are many areas in which we are not taking advantage as we should be. We kick up a storm when three trees are removed from the middle of the road where they should never have been but then we have, as a country, stopped planting forests. Not everyone can have a garden in front of their door, but let\u2019s make gardens where there\u2019s space for them. Quality of life is having more spaces like Buskett, not having a tree in the middle of the road.\nThere has been controversy over your own applications for a house and swimming pool on ODZ land. Was this a case of salami slicing? Did you apply for the house and swimming pool separately because they wouldn\u2019t have been approved together?\nNo. I think together or separately it was all in line with policy and there have been hundreds of other applications like it. This is all about a single person who is obsessed with me and creating a story about everything I do.\nThe Ombudsman said your decision to file the permit in your project manager\u2019s name was \u201cdevious\u201d.\u00a0\nThere were architects who said the Ombudsman was not technically correct. His issue was that I did not apply in my own name, but now I have an objection from the same person saying I only got the permit because I am the minister responsible.\nAs minister, doesn\u2019t what you do set an example for other developers?\nI would be setting a bad example if I had applied for something that was not in line with policy.\nAs for your own future, with the Prime Minister having said he will step down before the next general election, do you see yourself as a contender for that role?\nIt is a hypothetical question. The Prime Minister is still there and people, including me, want him to stay.\nI am nearly 33, I am a minister with a very large portfolio and when the Prime Minister has shown so much faith in me, it would be wrong of me to concentrate on the future rather than what is in front of me.

Last November it had introduced the BOV Salary Package, designed to cater for foreign individuals working in Malta, and also offers the Basic Payment Account, which gives consumers legally resident in Malta or the European Economic Area access to basic features, the\u00a0right to comparability of fees and payment account switching locally and across borders.\nBut while the bank had taken an active role in servicing the banking requirements of corporate and personal clients, these services were provided so long as they fell within the bank\u2019s customer acceptance policy and risk appetite framework, adhering to the \u2018know your customer\u2019 and due diligence rules and regulations, Mr Azzopardi said.\nMarcel Cassar, the CEO of APS Bank, said APS fully abided by EU and Maltese laws, rules and regulations.\nThe bank showed \u201cno reticence\u201d in opening new accounts, he said, offering a whole suite of deposit accounts addressed at all segments of society, without distinction.\nThe suite, he added, included the Basic Payment Account, with basic features available to consumers legally resident in Malta or in another EU Member State who did not have other bank accounts in Malta.\nThere is absolutely no truth whatsoever in any suggestion that legitimate people and businesses are being prevented from opening an account\n\u201cThere is absolutely no truth whatsoever in any suggestion that legitimate people and businesses are being prevented from opening an account with APS Bank,\u201d Mr Cassar insisted.\nHe said last year had set a record in terms of business growth, lending and deposit raising.

This is why I say that legitimate persons should not find any problem in opening a basic account at APS Bank.\u201d\nMr Cassar added that some applicants for business (less so of the BPA kind) might experience delays in getting approval or might even be declined.\n\u201cThere will be good reasons for this, it is never our pleasure to do so \u2013 we are out to grow our business! But we must also comply with the law, protect the integrity of the bank, of the financial system and above all our reputation and that of Malta.\n\u201cThere is an abundance of good, legitimate consumers and businesses out there and we want to service them.

Malta has already been pillared for the money laundering allegations against Pilatus Bank and its alleged Venezuela money-laundering schemes.\n\u201cHSBC burned its fingers in countries like Mexico and has decided to be more careful not to lose its banking licence in jurisdictions like the US.

Project co-ordinator Peter Busuttil tells Ramona Depares that it\u2019s all about creating a community.\nIt\u2019s Wednesday evening and the Mqabba football ground is a hive of activity. Some youngsters are warming up quietly in a corner; others are practising their dribbling skills, passing the ball to their peers, giggling and trying to make sure that the \u2018rivals\u2019 don\u2019t get their hands \u2013 well, feet \u2013 on it.\nMqabba FC coach Michael Degiorgio shouts out some instructions, and the whole group moves towards the centre of the ground as one. Some parents look on, quietly sipping a coffee or chattering among them.\nSo far, so mundane, you might say. Only, it\u2019s not, because the Mqabba football club is one of a number of local clubs that opted to be part of a community inclusion programme that was recently launched nationwide by the Malta Football Association (MFA) \u2013 which means that a number of migrant children, teens and (in some cases) even adults get to join their Maltese counterparts on the pitch.\nThe ratio, today, is a nice mix between Maltese teenagers and some 20 Syrian migrants who come from nearby Bir\u017bebbu\u0121a. Of course, in an ideal world, this sort of inclusion would be par for the course.\nBut, for now, full inclusion and diversity is still a goal that the majority of the Maltese population is still working towards \u2013 and this programme promises to be one of a number of such initiatives that are already making a difference.\nPeter Busuttil is the project coordinator and responsible for Football Social Responsibility at the MFA. He is the driving force behind the project, which is titled Include Me and I will Understand; he tells me it was launched last year and is being co-funded by the MFA and the EU, with some additional funding last year coming through the Uefa Football and Refugees Grant. The project funding has been renewed through 2019.\nThe project, he adds, helps both Maltese and migrants, as the MFA is working hand in hand with local agencies like Leap and Appo\u0121\u0121 to attract the participation of Maltese. To date, Include Me and I Will Understand has attracted some 300 participants.\n\u201cThe aim is not simply that of engaging migrants and Maltese who are in a vulnerable situation in social activities and sports, but also to include them within the community. The priority is to enable an environment where they can train and play football together. As part of the project, we also offer language lessons,\u201d he says.\nTo date, the project has attracted some 300 participants\nA nationwide call was issued to football clubs, and a healthy number showed interest in participating.\n\u201cFootball is a very social activity, because it\u2019s not just about the game. So many people are involved, from coaches to referees, to parents, teachers, volunteers...\u201d Mr Busuttil says.\nTraining typically brings with it a host of other social events, from picnics to that most famed of all Maltese activities \u2013 just hanging out together, having a natter.\n\u201cWe are very pleased with the way the programme is working because inclusion is taking place organically. It is heart-warming,\u201d Mr Busuttil continues.\n\nMr Degiorgio echoes these words. The club currently counts 20 to 25 migrants who are taking part in the programme, with ages ranging between seven and 17.\n\u201cEach one of them trains with their relevant age group and there is a very encouraging air of positivity on the pitch and around. Most are from Syria, and our languages are surprisingly similar, so communication has not been a problem. I was very pleased to see them being welcomed by our crowd, and inclusion seems to have happened very naturally,\u201d Mr Degiorgio says.\nThe youngsters themselves have shown an encouraging eagerness to be part of the whole social scene at the club, with not even the most adverse of weather conditions stopping them from showing up for the weekly sessions.\n\u201cYou can tell that they are genuinely into it. We had a couple of bad storms, and they didn\u2019t use it as an excuse to skive off training. As it turns out, the weather was too bad to be out on the pitch anyway, but we still chilled at the club and had fun,\u201d he says.\nNow, Mr Degiorgio is working to get the under 15s and under 17s registered so that they will be able to take part in competitive leagues, together with their peers.\nThe programme makes it possible for participants to truly become 100 per cent part of the scene, thanks to a holistic approach that also provides ancillary needs like a full training kit and, when needed, transport to and from the clubs.\nSan \u0120wann coach Christopher Sant attests to the efficacy of this holistic approach. His club currently includes about 11 migrant children aged between five and seven.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t just play football. We organise regular events, some of them with a cultural or heritage angle, such as outings to the valley, viewing the cart ruts and so forth,\u201d he tells me.\nThe programme has been welcomed by NGOs, with ADITUS director Neil Falzon pointing out the importance of initiatives that\u00a0 remind us of \u201cour shared humanity\u201d.\n\u201cThese activities highlight that we should not be talking about \u2018migrants integrating in Malta\u2019 but of \u2018communities integrating with each other\u2019.

All five told the police that they had purchased their supplies from the accused who worked at the garage.\nOn that same afternoon, the accused, together with Mark Pace and his brother, were arrested at Luqa when the police zoomed in on a Toyota vehicle that was stopped in the Ta\u2019 Kandja area. All three were held as suspects in a drug trafficking conspiracy.\nMeanwhile, another team of officers swooped down upon the Qormi premises, entering the home overlying the garage, where they eventually arrested the fourth suspect, namely Giovanna Pace, the mother of the two co-accused brothers.\nA scuffle broke out between the officers and the woman who had first allegedly locked herself in the bedroom and then put up a struggle, biting one policewoman on the thigh and pushing over another officer, while setting the family dog upon the police party.\nThe woman had later claimed that she had mistaken the plainclothes officer for a weapon-wielding robber and had also been stunned by pepper spray aimed at her.\nAll four suspects were ultimately prosecuted for their alleged involvement in a drug-trafficking conspiracy, as well as for the aggravated possession and trafficking of heroin, cocaine and cannabis resin.\nFailed to prove existence of drug-trafficking deal\nOne month later, in May 2004, one of the Pace brothers was cleared upon lack of sufficient evidence to be placed under a bill of indictment.\nProceedings continued against the other three co-accused who, though facing the prospect of a trial before the Criminal Court, ultimately had their case heard by a magistrate after the Attorney General issued his direction in January 2015 for proceedings to continue before the Magistrates\u2019 Courts in terms of law.\nIn June 2016, Mr Mazzitelli and the other two accused parted ways as the court directed the separation of proceedings.\nTaking the witness stand in February 2017, Mr Mazzitelli had recounted how at the time of his arrest he used to work at the garage where he met Mark Pace when the latter turned up at the workplace between spells spent behind bars.\nWhilst admitting under oath that in his youth, he used to smoke cannabis joints, the accused had insisted that he had \u201cnever touched heroin or cocaine,\u201d nor had he ever trafficked drugs.\nFollowing his arrest, the man claimed to have never returned to the mechanic\u2019s garage.\nTwo witnesses, who had first claimed to have bought drugs from the accused, had years later supplied a \u201ctotally different version\u201d in court, stating that they had originally made up the whole story since they had been feeling \u201csick\u201d owing to their drug dependency and had simply wanted to escape further questioning by the police.\nAnother witness failed to identify the accused in court. Only one of the witnesses identified the accused as \u201cthe man in a red jumper\u201d who had sold him the drugs.\nThe court, presided over by Magistrate Audrey Demicoli, observed that all these witnesses had over the years been involved in drug cases and had likely pinpointed the accused so as not to get into trouble with Mark Pace, the real supplier of the drugs.\nTheir testimony was deemed untrustworthy and not credible by the court. After examining both direct and circumstantial evidence, the court concluded that \u201cthe prosecution failed to prove that there existed any drug-trafficking agreement between the accused and third parties\u201d. Nor was it proved that the accused had trafficked drugs from the garage where he had been employed.\nAll that turned out to have been sufficiently proved was the fact that at the time of the alleged incident, the accused used to smoke cannabis joints, which, upon his own admission in open court, amounted to simple possession.\nThis offence, coupled with the charge of recidivism over a similar 2002 conviction, landed the accused with a \u20ac100 fine.\nIn separate proceedings, Mark Pace was condemned to a 15-month jail term and a \u20ac5,000 fine after pleading guilty to trafficking drugs.\nThe other co-accused, Giovanna Pace, was acquitted of all drug-related charges, being found guilty of threatening police officers, slightly injuring one of them, violently resisting arrest and refusing to obey legitimate orders.

This is inducated by research conducted by DeFrancesco and Casas (2004), Kitchen and Kitchen (2013) and Vazou & Skrade (2017).\nThe present author recently conducted a quasi-experimental research study to explore whether combining PE and Maths for school children would indeed lead to improvement in problem-solving skills and their overall attainment in the subject.\nThe programme had a substantial positive impact on students\u2019 perceptions towards PE and towards Maths, with the majority stating they feel they improved in both subjects\nThe study tried to develop, implement and evaluate a Mathematics and PE programme (MPEP) by integrating Maths and PE and measure its effects on problem-solving and academic attainment in a Maltese boys\u2019 school. This type of integration was defined as \u201can educational process in which two or more subject areas are integrated with the goal of fostering enhanced learning in each subject area\u201d by Cone and Cone (1998) in Parish and Parish (2016). The study adopted a quasi-experimental research design using mixed-methodology; it combined pre- and post-tests with follow-up (process evaluation) questionnaires, focus group and interviews.\nThe MPEP intervention was tested on a group of 26 students, while another 55 students served as the control group. The study sample included three Year 6 classes from a boys\u2019 school in Malta. The intervention class participated in the MPEP for eight weeks, while the other two classes had regular PE lessons. Student attainment was then assessed through a school-based Maths assessment. Students\u2019 and teachers\u2019 views and perceptions of the impact of the MPEP on problem-solving and Mathematical attainment were also recorded.\nAlthough results showed minimal improvement in problem-solving and general Mathematical scores within the intervention group, results from the post-test questionnaires and focus groups showed that the MPEP had a substantial positive impact on students\u2019 perceptions towards PE and towards Maths, with the majority stating they feel they improved in both subjects. Students also remarked that the MPEP helped them persevere and work harder because they could try things out in a \u2018physical\u2019 manner rather than learning mathematical concepts the traditional way.\u00a0 Indeed, the MPEP also contributed towards better teamwork among the students.\nSince this was a small-scale study conducted in a homogeneous (boys\u2019) school, results cannot be generalised. It would therefore be interesting if such a study is repeated in other schools to explore whether the same or similar results could be obtained (for example, among girls-only schools or among students in a co-ed school).\nThis study could serve as a stepping stone towards further, wider and deeper investigation on how such a new practice and the introduction of such a programme could be beneficial for our students in our schools.\nRamon Formosa conducted the study as part of a Master of Science in Physical Education and Sport Pedagogy at the University of Birmingham, from which he graduated in December 2018.

No dates were mentioned.\nWhen presenting the draft deed to the parliamentary committee a day before Parliament stopped for the Christmas holidays, Dr Mizzi admitted that the parameters of the proposed agreement were based on a similar deal the government had made with the Seabank db Group involving the sale of public land on which the Institute for Tourism Studies stood.\nThe db Group deal is being investigated by the Auditor General.\nThe minister wanted the committee to approve the draft deed that same day but Nationalist MPs Beppe Fenech Adami and Mario de Marco objected and insisted the Opposition wanted more time to study the agreement that was changing the parameters of the whole concession given to the group in the 1990s.\nAccording to the still unpublished draft deed, the whole of the St George\u2019s Bay peninsula, considered the most lucrative real estate on the Maltese islands, would be handed over to the Corinthia under a new 99-year temporary emphyteusis.\nTimes of Malta has reported that, in contrast to the original deed, in which the Corinthia was only allowed to use the public land for tourism purposes, mainly hotels, the government conceded to allow the hotel chain, which has strong foreign shareholding, the possibility to build up to 100,000 square metres of apartments and offices for rent or sale.\nIn return, Corinthia promised to pay a premium of \u20ac17 million for public land, which estate agents estimate would fetch at least \u20ac700 million in line with present market prices.\nAs part of the deal, the hotel chain also promised to upgrade two of its existing hotels there.\nIn the wake of harsh criticism by the business community, particularly developers and real estate agents, accusing the government of \u201cselling public land for peanuts while distorting the market\u201d, the government decided to re-start negotiations in a bid to mellow the proposed deal and make it more \u201csellable\u201d.\nSources close to the negotiations described the ongoing talks as \u201ccosmetic\u201d and aimed at eliminating the possibility that the deal would be seen by the EU as breaching state aid rules.", "comment_count": 27, "id": 2498}, {"keywords": "", "author": "Ivan Martin", "article_body": "A Maltese mobile phone gamer is hoping to go pro as he travels to the \u2018World Cup\u2019 of a popular strategy game this weekend.\u00a0\n\nSpending hours glued to your mobile phone, crushing \u2018candy\u2019 or catapulting \u2018angry birds\u2019 might seem like a bad habit for most, but not for 18-year-old Angelo Vella who is hoping to make a name for himself on mobile gaming phenomenon Clash Royale.\nHis index finger and thumb gliding over his phone\u2019s screen, Mr Vella told the Times of Malta how he spends around five hours a day transfixed to the strategy game that sees players engage in one-on-one face-offs using decks of digital playing cards.\nAfter coming up on top at the Malta qualifiers last year, the gamer will this weekend be representing the country in a worldwide showdown in Germany with a \u20ac50,000 prize pool at stake.\nBut his hopes are not limited to bringing home the prize money.
