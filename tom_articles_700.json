It was \u201cshabby\u201d, confused concepts and contradicted established European constitutional doctrine. He attacked what he termed a \u201cHenry 8 clause\u201d which, he said, would allow the minister to amend the law by means of a simple legal notice.\nAll institutions are at the beck and call of the Prime Minister\nThe nomenclature \u201cAttorney General\u201d, he added, was normally reserved in Commonwealth countries to refer to the chief legal adviser to the Government and not to the director of public prosecutions, which the new Attorney General would be.\u00a0\nHe said the AG would retain the power to chair various important judicial and investigative committees and boards.\nDr Azzopardi said the government failed to establish an independent magisterial office with the power to unilaterally initiate magisterial inquiries. The existence of six different and inconsistent appointment committees, whose tasks could easily be carried out by a single committee, would also cause confusion.\nHe referred to a controversy surrounding apparent ministerial access to confidential portions of the Egrant inquiry.\nGovernment MP Edward Zammit Lewis said the Opposition was factually incorrect to call for the separation of the Office of the Attorney General from the government.\nFor some time, the British Attorney General had attended Cabinet, he said, and the Venice Commission referred to the government\u2019s \u201creasonable\u201d wish to retain control over the appointment of the Maltese Attorney General.\nThe only European country where the Attorney General was appointed in the fashion being suggested by the Opposition was Hungary, Dr Zammit Lewis added.\nHe said magistrates and judges were appointed by a simple majority of the House and asked whether they too were seen to be partial by the Opposition.", "comment_count": 32, "id": 100}, {"keywords": "Accident", "author": "", "article_body": "Updated at 6.30pm\nA large grass fire in Marsalforn sparked a gas cyclinder explosion in the town on Wednesday afternoon.\nThe fire and subsequent explosion in the area known as Qolla Safra caused structural damage to a room and sent massive plumes of smoke rising above the seaside town.

Today, expectations are higher. People with disabilities want more \u2013 they want more inclusion, more education and employment opportunities, more leisure options, more potential for relationships and intimacy, more autonomy\u2026 more of everything, and rightly so. This is the reality. We want control over our own lives, we do not want our lives to be decided by anyone but us.\nDuring these past five years we have seen a spike in reports of discrimination against people with disabilities. This does not necessarily mean that there is more discrimination, but simply that more people with disabilities have become more aware of their rights. In today\u2019s society there are more scenarios where discrimination may be encountered; our lives are fuller, more complicated.

And it is working well because the system is enforced. Of course, there are still people with disabilities who are unemployed, or who are looking for work. There need to be created more opportunities for people with mental disabilities, for example.

Some directives impact vulnerable people negatively; even worse, the curriculum is outdated and doesn\u2019t promote inclusion.\nHas not the LSA system helped in this respect?\nBeing in the classroom with an LSA is not inclusion.

The way the system works means that a child is given an LSA as soon as the slightest thing is spotted \u2013 for example, in cases of a speech delay. An LSA is not needed in every case.\nDuring the first semester of 2018, between 100 and 120 pupils at kindergarten level were given an LSA, and this alarms me. Is it a case of teachers not wanting to assume responsibility?\nWhen a child who doesn\u2019t need an LSA is given one, it can be a burden. Consider that when you join the workforce, you will not have an LSA to facilitate matters.\nOf course, once a child is assigned an LSA it is very difficult to take away the option later. Parents would be up in arms, by then the child is used to having an LSA and so forth. This is why I don\u2019t believe in this system; I worry that we are encouraging a culture of dependence, not autonomy. LSAs should only be assigned to those who really need them. I have seen children with the same condition that I have \u2013 spina bifida \u2013 who can\u2019t function without the crutch of an LSA. As a child, I was never assigned one and today I am autonomous. This is a difficult concept to explain to parents, of course. But today\u2019s children have more potential and opportunities than I had when I was young, and these should not be nipped at the bud.\nHow can we achieve more inclusion within the education system?\nFor starters, the LSA system needs to be finetuned, as described above. Then there is the other issue of special schools. The idea behind inclusive education is to remove segregation, which means that special schools need to be used in moderation. I do not believe in cutting someone away from the rest of society. Children with disabilities should be attending normal schools, the same as everyone else does, and if special schooling is required that can be done within limited hours.\nCreating peripheral centres does not foster inclusion. I will not accept that more people continue being sent to these schools. Instead, we need support measures so that children can receive their education within the normal classroom. It is the duty of the education department to make sure that this happens, to fulfil its obligation of making education accessible to everyone.\nWill this help employability?\nWell, as things stand there is a lacuna between education and employment, with some people finding it difficult to transition, or to adept to fulltime employment.\nIs there a viable solution to this?\nWe need to invest in social enterprises and co-operatives. This endeavour needs to be taken seriously and to be implemented with a solid structure, following a tried-and-tested model. In this way, those who attend day centres can work alongside the rest of society.\nAnother step in the right direction was the introduction of the minimum wage for those who cannot be employed. But there are other measures that I disagreed with, such as the two-year employment programmes that come to an end when the funding finishes. Which means that you have a person who suddenly ends up with no employment, when they could be playing a productive part in society. In these cases, government has always helped identify other employment opportunities, but the system needs to be adapted so as to work seamlessly.\nThe dynamics of society when relating to people with disabilities has changed. Today, expectations are higher\nHas society come to accept that people with disabilities have a right to the same opportunities and lifestyle as everyone else?\nMostly, people have started to realise that everyone has something to offer. A look at social media is enough to show us that improvements have been made. But still, there are those who still think of us as a charity case.\nThen there is the other issue, this perception that people with disabilities are \u2018superhuman\u2019, or an \u2018inspiration\u2019. We are normal people. I am not an inspiration, I simply did everything I could to live my life the way I wanted to.\nYou mentioned that accessibility on the street is as bad as it was 10 years ago. Can you elaborate?\nIt\u2019s a disaster. The kerbs are not accessible to people with disabilities. The positive aspect is that we are working closely with Infrastructure Malta to create guidelines that will improve the situation. We tend to complain a lot about festa street decorations because they are an obstruction, but reality is that this happens once a year. On a daily basis there is a plethora of other obstructions, and these include things that you would never look at and think twice. Garbage bags and plants, for instance. These will both stop a person on a wheelchair in their tracks. The pavements need to be obstacle-free and kept only for pedestrians, otherwise we cannot talk of accessibility.\nWhat are the other priorities?\nEnforcement, which remains a joke and needs strengthening across multiple contexts. It is useless to legislate for the accessibility of buildings, pavements and parking spots if we fail to enforce the law properly. Take the Blue Badge system; it took a lot of work to implement, but unfortunately the enforcers are not familiar with the way it is meant to work.\nOn multiple occasions, I have been informed that, when a Blue Badge parking spot is taken by someone who has no right to do so, law enforcers will call that person to remove the car. This is not what the law lays down \u2013 the law requires the car to be fined and towed. We need the enforcers to be trained to become familiar with the legal system.\nOn a positive note, the local councils do work with us very closely on these matters and our Compliance Unit is in constant liaison with them.\nIn 2017 you had suggested that Malta needs to also look into the employment of sex workers for people with a disability. Have there been any developments in this regard?\nI am being cautious about this topic. I have sounded the different opinions of people, because it is my duty to do so, but changes happen gradually in society, of course.\u00a0 A group of people had communicated their wishes to me, and it is my job to deliver their message out there. I do not necessarily agree that sex workers are the best way to ensure sexual rights, but as Commissioner I cannot ignore what the people wish to discuss. I am not here to discuss my\u00a0 personal agenda, after all.\nOne aspect that worries me with respect to sexual rights are recent reports about some parents being anti-sex education in schools. Such news affects people with disabilities too, as there is a need for more sex education, not less.\nWhen it comes to sexual relationships for people with disabilities, we tend to segregate. There is this perception that it is fine for some people with specific disabilities to have sex, while for others it isn\u2019t. The latter is true particularly with respect to those with mental disabilities, such as Down\u2019s Syndrome. I have witnessed parents ruin the relationships of their children.\nIf we take a look at the situation abroad, we will see that yes, there are couples of mixed abilities and their relationship functions well. We have caught up with this way of thinking in terms of disabilities of a physical or a sensorial nature, but we still tend to over-protect those with intellectual disabilities (inpo\u0121\u0121uhom f\u2019bozza). This attitude does not augur well for any proposals regarding sex workers.\nDo you believe that this attitude will change anytime soon?\nIt will take time. And we also need to address the basics, first, such as accessibility. For now, it is more a matter of pushing for a homogenous sexual health policy, one that includes people with disabilities and doesn\u2019t segregate them. We cannot ignore reproductive rights, for instance, and we cannot ignore what these people want. As an example, I am not in favour of abortion, but I cannot ignore that there will be women who are pro-choice. We need to discuss these issues.\nThe only thing that frustrates me about the topic of abortion is when some movements promote it in case of a birth defect. This is completely against what the Commission stands for. If we continue treating people with disabilities in this way, then we may as well close shop and go home.\nHow can we ensure that all these issues that affect people with disabilities take priority on the national agenda?\nWe need political representation by people who are familiar with the needs and the laws related to disabilities. I do not believe in quotas, but people with disabilities need to be given a real chance to get to Parliament using their own skills. What is needed to make this happen is more support, including from the political parties themselves and from the system in general. Some of the challenges can be resolved through funding; others through training and a support structure, including a strong team to assist.\nWe have seen people with disabilities succeed in politics in other countries. There is a town in Spain where the vice-mayor has Down\u2019s Syndrome.

Studies abroad have demonstrated frequency rates ranging from 11 per cent to 43 per cent in similar institutions.\nThe most common protective factors include religion and relatives, Dr Xuereb pointed out.\nContrary to popular belief, he said, depression was not a normal part of aging but \u201cone of the most common and treatable mental health disorders among the elderly, especially in those residing in long-term care institutions\u201d.\nThe elderly in long-term care institutions were normally older than those living in the community. They had greater physical and cognitive difficulties and might find it hard to adapt to their loss of independence and their new routine.\nThese circumstances all increased the risk of depression and suicidality.\nThe MAP conference will be held on June 13 and 14.
