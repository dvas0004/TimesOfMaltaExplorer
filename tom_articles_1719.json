The priory building is mostly on three floors at Old Bakery Street with another two floors of rented housing and shops beneath the convent onto Old Mint Street. The oratory occupies part of the ground floor beneath the Augustinian convent. Structural changes were made in 1845, converting part of it into a sacristy.\nFr Alex has joined forces with German cultural manager Xenia Lorenz-Rebers, who explained how she fell in love with the historical and cultural aspect of the priory while on a visit to Malta. When she realised that parts of the building and some of the artworks were in danger of perishing unless urgent restoration interventions were carried out, Ms Lorenz-Rebers was determined to come up with a plan to save them.\nAt the moment they are in a dire state\n\u201cThe entire monastery is impressive. Fr Alex explained that some \u20ac9,000 is needed in order to carry out the necessary works, but of course he doesn\u2019t have access to those funds. I went back home to Germany and gave the matter some thought. Eventually, I came back to Malta, discussed it with Fr Alex and we set up a plan,\u201d Ms Lorenz-Rebers said.\nThe first event takes place on June 5 and will feature blind pianist Anton Belousov. The 26-year-old musician is considered a prodigy, having been born blind and starting to learn to play the piano at the age of seven, under very difficult conditions. He is currently performing as a solo-pianist, and orchestra pianist, with the Philharmonic Orchestra of St Petersburg and the Philharmonic Orchestra Ryazan.\nWhen he learnt about the features of the priory, Mr Belousov was immediately interested, and expressed enthusiasm to be part of the project.\n\u201cHe told me: \u2018I cannot see the beauty of the church in which I will be playing, because I am blind, but I can still feel the presence of God, and it is an honour for me to contribute to such a project, playing for the people in Malta\u2019,\u201d Ms Lorenz-Rebers said.\nThe concert is not a one-off, but marks the beginning of a project called Concert & Dinner, which will see up to three events taking place until the end of year, each one featuring different musicians. All proceeds will go towards the funding of the restoration works.\n\u201cThe idea is to get the audience more involved in the story and the needs of the priory, thanks to an intimate setting. After the concert, while enjoying dinner, guests will be able to converse with the musicians themselves,\u201d Ms Lorenz-Rebers said.\nAll work being carried out on this project, she added, is being done on a voluntary basis, from the design of the poster to the services she is providing herself.", "comment_count": 0, "id": 3021}, {"keywords": "", "author": "Sarah Carabott", "article_body": "Updated at 6.10pm with Education Ministry statement\nMalta has the second largest number of early school leavers in Europe, with one out of every six students quitting school in their teenage years.\nHowever, despite topping the list along Spain and Romania, Malta has managed to halve the share of early school leavers between 2006 and 2018, according to European data.\nAccording to Eurostat, early school leavers are those aged between 18 and 24 with, at most, lower secondary education and who are not in further education or training.\nIn 2006, a third of Maltese students left school early, a figure that dropped to 17.5% in 2018.

As a result, patients have been crammed into a few wards, with beds lined up too close to each other.\u00a0\nIn comments to this newspaper on Tuesday, Malta Union of Midwives and Nurses (MUMN) president Paul Pace confirmed that a meeting with the government was scheduled for Wednesday.\u00a0\nDuring the meeting, the union will be asking for work timelines, as it had in the past. However this time around, if these are not provided, industrial action would follow.\nReferring to comments on Monday by Health Minister Chris Fearne, who assured journalists that patients were safe at Mount Carmel and that the government had a five-year plan for the hospital, Mr Pace questioned how the wards could be considered \u201csafe\u201d when patients did not even have enough space to store their personal belongings.\u00a0\n\u201cI fail to understand how the minister could insist that while the parts of the hospital with serious infrastructural problems have been evacuated, the remaining areas are safe.\u00a0\n\u201cNurses cannot care for their patients\u2019 properly, because they cannot even access their beds. Those who are crammed in the few remaining wards are piled up so close to each other that they have to place their belongings on the floor because there is no space for a bedside table,\u201d Mr Pace said.\u00a0\nHe added it was unacceptable that the minister seemed to measure patients\u2019 safety by whether a ceiling is condemned or not.\u00a0\nPhotographs taken inside the hospital show scaffolding being used to support parts of the ceiling at risk of collapse.

But there are patients that we need to think of before decisions are taken, Mr Pace said when pressed to state what kind of action the union could be mulling.\nPatients have to place their belongings on the floor\nThe union head also dismissed comments by the minister that the government has a five-year plan for the hospital and that works are currently under way.\u00a0\n\u201cWe have been hearing this for years and yet we are still in the same situation we were three years ago, if not worse. Why are we still in the first year of this so-called five-year plan? The government claims to have allocated millions to refurbish Mount Carmel but we have yet to see any of this actually materialising,\u201d Mr Pace went on.\u00a0\nWhile the minister was quick to mention the five-year plan when faced with questions on the hospital, the union head said, the government repeatedly denied the MUMN a copy of an architect\u2019s report drawn up to identify the problems there.\u00a0\nOn whether nurses were refusing to work at the hospital, Mr Pace confirmed that the situation was so dire that none of the staff were voluntarily opting to be assigned there.\u00a0\nInstead, he explained, fresh graduates who failed to make it to the top of their class were being placed at the hospital after all the other positions in other hospitals were taken up by those scoring higher marks.\u00a0\n\u201cEveryone is quick to talk about stigma surrounding mental health issues but in reality, the problem is the hospital. People are likely to not speak up about their struggles because they fear being admitted to the run-down hospital,\u201d Mr Pace went on.\nIn the meantime, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Health said 104 patients have been relocated from Mount Carmel Hospital to Casa Maria, Prince of Wales, Sliema.\u00a0\n\u201cAll patients were assessed by their consultant carer prior to the move.

Why is an extra burden being placed on taxpayers without specific, transparent and widespread information as to the cost-benefit analysis of this measure?\u201d the lawyer asked, adding that foreign jurisdictions where State funding has been introduced are often criticised for the lack of transparency brought about by these mechanisms.\u00a0\n\u201cIf introduced in a piecemeal fashion,\u00a0it risks\u00a0becoming exorbitant,\u00a0unnecessarily complex, and discriminating in the levels of funding awarded across the various political groups,\u201d she said.\nThe lawyer also decried the way the proposals claim to be basing themselves on the Irish funding model, a reference that she described as \u201cdeceptive\u201d.\nThe potential for conflicts of interest is rife\n\u201cIn Ireland, political parties are sanctioned, by reduction of financial grant receivable, if certain equality measures are not adhered to.

But Mario Gerada insists that, while true that pesticides are a major cause for concern, a holistic approach to tackle the problem is needed.\n\u201cWe cannot demonise the farmer. As part of the Hub\u2019s research, we have met with the farmers and listened to their concerns. With respect to pesticides, they brought up a number of issues, such as when are the crops sampled. And how? When and where are they tested?\u201d Mr Gerada said.\nREAD: Authority's pesticide test was 'flawed' - Environment Ministry\nThe results of this series of meetings were then collated into a list of policy requests from the farmers, combined with recommendations by the Hub and presented to Parliamentary Secretary for Agriculture Clint Camilleri.\u00a0\n\u201cThe current system sees produce being tested for pesticides in a foreign laboratory, with the results taking about a year, give or take, to reach Malta. Whenever the tests reveal that any crops are too high in pesticides, that particular farmer\u2019s produce is destroyed. But, in reality, the result would be referring to the previous year\u2019s crop cycle. This does not make sense,\u201d Mr Gerada said.\n\u201cMalta does not have any accredited labs to carry out the tests locally, and the expense to implement local testing would be considerable. But a solution needs to be found.\u201d\nIt was \u201can objective fact\u201d that some farmers were using pesticides excessively, he said, but one also had to investigate the reasons in order to tackle the root of the problem. \u201cIn reality the majority are abiding by pesticide regulations. It\u2019s just a matter of getting everyone in line.\u201d\nThe relationship between farmers and authorities has not always been \u201cthe best\u201d possible, he admits, putting this down to heavy bureaucracy. And, while farmers need to comply with regulations, teaching them how best to comply with the system is imperative, he says.\n\u201cWe need to depart from a position of care, as opposed to punishment. The industry was neglected for years, by all administrations, so the relationship between farmer and authorities needs to be rebuilt. No-one wants to eat pesticide-laden food, but a way needs to be found within a context of care.\u201d\nREAD:\u00a0How pesticides are monitored\nOne possible way of facilitating dialogue between farmers and government, Mr Gerada believes, would be to turn the government farm in G\u0127ammieri into a practical centre for research and dialogue in partnership with the farmers themselves.\n\u201cThe idea would be to transform the farm into a space where farmers can present the difficulties they encounter in their day-to-day work in order to discuss possible solutions. Let us say that farmers encounter a new kind of insect that they don\u2019t know how to eliminate. It is more likely that they figure out a way to solve the problem without resorting to excessive pesticides if they have other experts to discuss the issue with. L-G\u0127ammieri could serve as the base for these exchanges.\u201d\nMoreover, he continued, it was impossible to carry out a serious discussion about the use of pesticides without referring to the issue of traceability and imports.\n\u201cAt present, there is no system of traceability. All produce should be labelled, traceable and identifiable, both for regulatory purposes and for the consumer. We need to introduce a certificate of production that identifies the country of origin and safe use of pesticides.\u201d\nThe importance of traceability takes on a strong significance when considering the difference in pesticide regulations between EU and non-EU countries where pesticide laws are much more lax.\u201d\nFarmers lament the injustice of getting punished while others get off scot-free for the same thing.\n\u201cFor a long time, farmers have suffered a negative image and been looked down upon by the community in general. Our approach as a Hub has been to facilitate dialogue between all parties concerned, as we believe that this is more likely to lead to a long-term and reasonable solution than by focusing on purely punitive measures.\u201d\nThe Ministry for Agriculture says spot checks for pesticides are carried out at the Pitkali Market, with about 50 surprise inspections carried out this year so far. Onsite inspections are also carried out to verify that the vegetables being delivered to the markets are locally grown and that producers with specific products truly cultivate the products they declare.\nA spokesman for the parliamentary secretary said a National Gene Bank would be established to safeguard against the possible loss of local varieties through the accidental introduction of harmful pests or diseases.

which range from the national orchestra to Heritage Malta - had contributed to national accounts, it did specify that the National Development and Social Fund was responsible for \u20ac133.7 million.\nThe fund gets 70 per cent of Individual Investor Programme funds, which allows wealthy foreign investors to buy Maltese citizenship.\u00a0\nThis means that even without those funds, the surplus would have been over \u20ac117 million.\nThere are other contributors to the gap between the consolidated fund\u2019s deficit and the surplus registered by the general government, made up of \u20ac208 million from various categories, with \u20ac62.5 million subtracted due to Air Malta payments for its assets.\n\nThe Maastricht Treaty reporting for 2017 had shown a surplus of \u20ac387.2 million in 2017, and of \u20ac90.9 million in 2016.\nTaken as a percentage of GDP, this represented a positive two per cent, well above the deficit-to-GDP ratio of three per cent \u2013 a crucial threshold which EU member states must remain above if they are to comply with their treaty obligations.\nAlthough the government's yearly accounts were in surplus, Malta continues to have overall debt of \u20ac5.7 billion -\u00a0\u20ac17.8 million less than in 2017.\nIncreases in GDP mean that this debt forms a smaller share of Malta's GDP, with the ratio going down from 50.2 per cent in 2017 to 46 per cent last year.\n'Strong finances' -

Speaking on condition of anonymity, the former fighter detailed how dog owners would parade their \u201cchampions\u201d around the horse racing track in Marsa, trying to attract challengers for a showdown on Sunday morning. \u201cIn my day it was about the challenge, it was pika (pique) and the fights were mostly about the skill of the dog. I\u2019m not saying it was right, and today there is a lot more awareness about animal rights, but my guess is that the fights today are much more violent,\u201d he told Times of Malta. Police sources on Monday indicated that the fights being investigated today were probably using breeds such as the pit bull, favoured by trainers for its obedience and willingness to continue fighting through extreme pain and exhaustion \u2013 something Maltese dog fighters call \u201czeal\u201d.The spectre of illegal dog fighting was raised in Parliament last Tuesday by Opposition MP Mario Galea who said he had been shocked to learn the heinous form of animal cruelty had made an unwelcome comeback in recent months.The matter is now being investigated by the police and animal welfare officials. Sources in both entities encouraged the public to come forward with any information they may have on the practice.\nAn increasingly violent 'sport'\nMeanwhile the former dog fighter told Times of Malta that several years ago he had been convinced to get involved in the fights by friends who attended dog fights for fun. The black market \u2018sport\u2019 would then see owners agree on an impartial referee, and meet in a field in rural \u0126andaq in the outskirts of Qormi \u2013 the same neighbourhood believed to be hosting the illegal fights today.In his day, the former dog fighter recounted, the breed of choice was a boxer mix \u2013 his had been a boxer mixed with a Maltese hunting dog (tal-ka\u010b\u010ba). The \u2018sport\u2019, he said, had resembled a form of wrestling, with dogs winning a fight if they asserted their dominance by climbing on top of their opponent for at least a minute unchallenged.\u201cIt would attract quite a crowd. Some would bet \u2013 sometimes for big money \u2013 others would just do it for the prestige of winning, or because of pique,\u201d he said, adding that he had once competed for a cup that dog owners had pitched in for. And, while attendance at these fights \u2013 held at around sunrise mainly on Sundays \u2013 was believed to have dwindled, they were also believed to have become increasingly violent.\nRewarding violence\nSources in the Veterinary Department said that dogs used for fights were typically raised in isolation, spending most of their lives on short, heavy chains and conditioned for fighting through the use of repeated violence and rewarding of extreme behaviour. Dogs made to participate in fights would likely have their ears cropped and tails docked close to their bodies to minimise the animal\u2019s normal body language cues and to limit areas that another dog can grab during a fight. Since it was illegal to make these bodily alterations to pets, fighting dog owners would keep their animals locked away from prying eyes, sources said. Meanwhile, the former dog fighter told Times of Malta that fights could take anything from a few seconds, to as long as half an hour, with animals often sustaining serious injuries. He recalled how, prior to fights, opponents would wash their rival\u2019s dog clean, to ensure that the animal had not been rubbed down with liquids that deterred other dogs from attacking.

He said Justice Minister Owen Bonnici had given him his word that the new bill would be tabled in Parliament before the beginning of the new forensic year.\nDr Degabriele, who has been a practising lawyer for more than three decades, said the profession was never regulated, except for a few provisions in the Code of Police Laws, which gave rise to complaints and diminished standards.\n\u201cNowadays there are more than 1,500 lawyers. In a completely changed socio-economic environment, we need to regulate the profession, with all the pressures and the temptations that lawyers face [so we need something] to maintain standards and ensure that those who do not maintain those standards are weeded out,\u201d he said.\nHe explained that through the new law, the Chamber of Advocates will become the regulator of the profession on a day\u2013to-day basis while the chamber will be regulated by the Commission for the Administration of Justice. The chamber will have the power to exercise discipline within the profession and monitor practicing lawyers in the daily practice of the profession.\nHe said this two-tier system will benefit not only lawyers but also clients, who can have peace of mind about the service they are to expect from their lawyers.\n\u201cThese are basic rules to ensure that the lawyers of tomorrow are better than us. We need to ensure that standards are not only maintained but we need to take these standards to a higher level,\u201d he said.\n\u201cNo lawyer can accept that standard of \u2018anything goes\u2019. It is a mentality that, as profession, we definitely cannot afford. We need to make sure that people in this profession, particularly the younger generations, understand this. The law is not going to teach you how to be prepared but it can give you the discipline to ensure that certain standards of integrity, independence and impartiality of thought are maintained,\u201d he added.\nHe stressed that lawyers should be able to tell their clients things that they do not want to hear because they are not always right.\nAsked about the Committee for Advocates and Legal Procurators, Dr Degabriele said this will now become the Advocates\u2019 Disciplinary Tribunal and will deal with complaints which do not involve the removal or suspension of a warrant, which would then be referred to the Commission for the Administration of Justice.\n\u201cThe committee was inundated with frivolous claims. Many cases which end up before this committee are complaints that their lawyer lost their case. There is also a three-month prescription period to observe. This division in disciplinary proceedings will make the committee work more efficiently by only dealing with cases which are substantiated,\u201d he said.\nNo lawyer can accept the standard of \u2018anything goes\u2019. It is a mentality that, as profession, we definitely cannot afford\nDr Degabriele said that a good number of complaints were about overcharging and most of them were not justified as the fees were set.\nThe maximum fine at law is pegged to one-tenth of the Attorney General\u2019s salary but at a time when lawyers are overseeing transactions involving millions of euros, he said this should increase.\nAsked whether the committee for the appointment of the judiciary was simply acting as a rubberstamp, Dr Degabriele disagreed.\n\u201cIt has a function and I honestly believe that the process can be improved. In fact, the committee is discussing this internally, with the intention to proceed with a system where the committee has more autonomy,\u201d he said.\nAccording to the lawyers\u2019 chief, the committee ought to have a wider base, and more sitting judges should participate in the process. The Chief Justice, the Auditor General, the Ombudsman, the Attorney General and the president of the Chamber of Advocates currently sit on the committee.\nWhile the committee at present only gives a recommendation, it should be able to give the State the name of a person who ought to be made a judge or magistrate, he said.\nTurning to the legal aid system, Dr Degabriele admitted that this needed \u201ca complete rehash\u201d, starting with a change to the means testing for eligibility.\nThe register is currently voluntary but Dr Degabriele believes that one of the options could be having a pool employed by the State or the court administration.\u00a0\u00a0 But in the meantime, he insisted that lawyers were duty-bound to offer the best possible service.\u00a0\nRegarding the duration of cases in court, Dr Degabriele said the average length of a case in the First Hall was down to two to three years from eight years. One of the bottlenecks, he said, was at appeals stage where it takes four to five years for a case to be appointed.\n\u201cThere is nothing which says that the judicial system is perfect but it is the best we have in a state of imperfection,\u201d he said.\nHe suggested that appeals should be decided by judges based on written submissions rather than entire sittings, except if clarifications are needed.\nHe also criticised the way cases are heard in court, with judges expecting lawyers to be in two places at the same time.\n\u201cIf the court were to have an appointment system and everyone is connected to the same database, lawyers cannot be given cases at the same time. In 2019, this is not artificial intelligence but a very simple calendar system which would give you a conflict if there\u2019s an overlap. I think this will benefit everyone.

Such measure came in the wake of repeated faults caused by abusive practices, which were also having an impact on the production of the so-called new water from the same plant, which is used by farmers for irrigation purposes.\n\u201cWhen there is a fault, often caused by illegal discharges, the only option is to shut down the plant for a few hours to cleanse the system - at the cost of having raw sewage flow straight into the sea,\u201d Mr Bilocca pointed out.\n\u201cIf the plant is not closed down, it would take weeks to recover until it reaches the required treatment parameters. During such period, farmers would also suffer as they would go for about two weeks without new water until the plant returns to normality,\u201d he continued.\nIllegal dumping of slurry in the sewers continues in Malta.\u00a0\nGiven that no equipment similar to the one in Gozo was installed at the three plants in Ta\u2019 Barkat in Xg\u0127ajra, which caters for 80 per cent of Malta\u2019s sewage, I\u010b-\u010aumnija, in Mellie\u0127a, and Sant\u2019Antnin, in Marsascala, which was being upgraded, how was the WSC coping, he was asked.\nMr Bilocca said that, in Malta, other systems were devised \u201cto stabilise the situation\u201d but he pointed out there were plans to install equipment similar to that at Ras il-\u0126ob\u017c.\nWhat options do Maltese farmers have to dispose of their slurry?

The information supplied indicated that retired race horses were being illegally slaughtered and the meat then sold for consumption.\nThe matter was first flagged by Nationalist MP Mario Galea who last week blew the whistle on a number of suspected animal rights abuses, including the possible return of dog fighting.\nThe sources noted that the illegal slaughter of animals raised a series of health concerns, not only because of the questionable hygiene standards during the killing process but also because of the fact that race horses were usually administered performance-enhancing drugs.\u00a0In 2010, officers found a workshop which had been modified to also operate as an illegal abbatoir.\nThe information furnished, the sources continued, indicated that horses could have been killed through asphyxiation, placing a bin bag over their heads and fastening it with a rope at the neck.\u00a0\n\u201cThis is particularly cruel because the animal will suffer for several minutes before eventually dying a painful death,\u201d they pointed out.

Still, horse meat available on the market was far bigger than what one would expect from 12 animals and while the bulk was likely imported and then marketed as being local produce, the sources would not rule out that illegally-slaughtered animals were being sold to local consumers.\nThis is not the first time that the authorities are looking into the practice of illegal animal slaughter.

Several candidates for next month\u2019s European elections took part. Mr Cramer\u2019s appearance was arranged by independent candidate Arnold Cassola.\n\u201cYou have a big problem with traffic jams, and a tunnel will attract more cars, so the time that would be gained in the tunnel would be lost in exacerbated traffic jams,\u201d Mr Cramer said.\nThe tunnel itself could become a bottleneck in peak times\n\u201cThe plan is for a one-lane tunnel that feeds into wider roads, and the tunnel itself could become a bottleneck in peak times. This means that a tunnel is not likely to improve the time it takes to get to your destination.\u201d\n\nThe German MEP says that the Committee on Transport and Tourism is focused on three principles: \u201cto avoid, to shift and to improve\u201d transport networks to steer Europe away from private car use. This because the \u201cgrowth of 25 per cent of CO2 emissions in transport since 1990 is nullifying CO2 savings in other sectors.\u201d\nHe elaborates: \u201cWe are decisive on co-financing: 80 per cent of co-financing is going into rail and inland waterway projects. The European Parliament has decided that at least 40 per cent of EU money on transport has to go into rail.\u201d\nHe mentions trams as the overall solution for Malta, something that the EU could more readily co-finance.\nAnd he dismissed talk by Dr Borg that the tunnel could be financed by the TEN-T network funding in the future.\nMr Cramer talks of electric bikes as ideal for short trips in Malta, citing research showing that most cars trips are less than 6km. As for transport to Gozo, Malta could learn from Denmark\u2019s zero-emission ferries that are serving transport needs superbly.\n\u201cMalta may make the same mistake as the Channel Tunnel,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was devised to be financed by shareholders but costs of construction almost doubled. Even after plans were altered for a rail tunnel during the construction itself \u2013 initially it was supposed to be a road and rail tunnel \u2013 the private shareholders ended up losing 60 per cent of their investment. By the time the tunnel was completed, the company had gone bankrupt.\u201d\nAnalysis: Faith over science?\nLast Wednesday\u2019s motion in Parliament in favour of a tunnel to Gozo was supported by the PL and PN, while the two PD MPs deliberately and symbolically \u201cboycotted the sham discussion\u201d.\nHowever, with studies to back up the project yet to be published, the vote can be seen as merely an act of political faith.\nThe Prime Minister talked of the tunnel options \u2013 whether dug deep underground or immersed on the seabed \u2013 as something that has yet to be decided. This runs contrary to previous assertions of the tunnel being at the \u201cimplementation stage\u201d.\nOpinion: The Gozo tunnel panic - Arnold Cassola\nAll talk about the tunnel shows that the project is still at the conceptualisation stage and that its funding and operation remain fluid.\nIn last year\u2019s project description statement issued by Transport Malta, the tunnel was described as underground \u2013 bored either above or below the layer of blue clay. This remained an open question in the report.\nThe tunnel would be financed and constructed by a private entity that would then operate it for 20 years. This has led to questions about financial feasibility: whether it would be possible to rake in a return on investment and make a profit within 20 years.\nThis is something that is in turn dependent on evolving sea transport connections. The need for a tunnel could wane once the long-promised fast ferry to Valletta becomes operational and other sea-transport connections are expanded or forged. These might include a slow ferry to Valletta, a service that was abruptly halted in 2015 to make way for a yacht marina and has yet to be resumed, as was hinted at the time.\nQuestions have also been raised about the geologic feasibility of the tunnel. Scepticism by outspoken geologist Peter Gatt led to Infrastructure Malta responding late last year that detailed geological studies were being conducted. It is not known whether these studies have been completed.\nLast week Transport Minister Ian Borg promised to publish all studies but it is unclear whether they will include any detailed geological studies.\nTalk by Dr Borg two weeks ago that the tunnel may be eligible for EU funding as part of an expanded TEN-T network \u2013 revision of the network is expected in the early 2020s \u2013 shows that uncertainty remains about whether the project shall be delivered by a private entity or the government itself.\nFor a private entity, financial feasibility remains the proverbial elephant in the room: making a return on investment and running a profit from the daily pool of 9,000 vehicles projected to make the crossing by 2030 could make fares prohibitively high and encourage drivers to use the ferries instead.\nAnd for the government, if it has to fund the tunnel, putting its bets on TEN-T funding may prove to be ephemeral.\nAll this casts serious doubt on the target date of 2024 for completion mentioned by Dr Borg last year.", "comment_count": 75, "id": 3115}, {"keywords": "", "author": "Denise Grech ", "article_body": "On social media, so-called influencers can be quite, well, influential, especially with their young audiences.

The feed of local online influencers is full of recommendations on the best products and places to eat. But how much of it is genuine?\nAccording to industry insiders who spoke to The Sunday Times of Malta, hardly any of it is. Some of Malta\u2019s major influencers are getting paid to post rave reviews of products and services, from skincare creams to ice cream parlours, often without disclosing they are getting paid to do so or that they have been given the product for free.\nBrands can pay anywhere from \u20ac50 to \u20ac200 for influencers to post pictures with a product, industry stakeholders added.\nThe reluctance to disclose sponsorships could have potentially serious legal implications, they said.
