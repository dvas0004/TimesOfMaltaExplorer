Forced labour victims included 17 Filipinos (13 from a single case), three Mauritians, one Nepali, and one Pakistani. Sixteen of the forced labour victims were male and six were female.

The government demonstrated overall increasing efforts compared to the previous reporting period.\nThese efforts, the reports says, included prosecuting more traffickers, hiring a social worker dedicated to trafficking victims, removing all residency and work permit fees for foreign victims of trafficking, and for the first time, identifying and referring a child victim to care.\nHowever, the government did not meet the minimum standards in several key areas. It has only convicted one trafficker since 2012, which resulted in a fully suspended prison sentence, identified fewer victims, continued to lack coordination among ministries, and did not effectively control licensing for massage parlours, where there was a high vulnerability for sex trafficking\nKey recommendations\n\u2022 The report calls on the Maltese authorities to vigorously investigate and prosecute trafficking offenses, including convicting traffickers and sentencing convicted traffickers to significant prison terms.\n\u2022 Efforts to proactively identify trafficking victims among vulnerable immigrant populations, particularly migrant workers and women in prostitution needed to be increased.\n\u2022 Improve licence control for massage parlours\n\u2022 Increase collaboration between police and other stakeholders during investigations.\n\u2022 Use anti-trafficking training for police officers, prosecutors, and judges to increase focus on working with victims.", "comment_count": 20, "id": 2233}, {"keywords": "Police, St Paul\u2019s Bay", "author": "", "article_body": "Updated 10.20am\nA decomposing corpse found in a garage in St Paul's Bay on Thursday afternoon has been identified as that of the Danish man who was reported missing earlier this month.\n\nHis identity was officially confirmed by police on Friday morning, although the cause of death has not yet been confirmed.\nAllan Hartmann-Jensen, 53, was reported missing on June 5.\nHe appeared to have been dead for some time, and an autopsy is to be carried out.\nA magisterial inquiry is underway.\n\u00a0", "comment_count": 0, "id": 2234}, {"keywords": "Politics", "author": "Jacob Borg", "article_body": "An annual declaration of assets filed by ministers and parliamentary secretaries has given insight into which Cabinet members have the most cash, investments and properties.\nThe man who holds the public purse strings is also the most cash rich of all the ministers.

He called upon the government to make room in Budget 2020 for pensions, in the same way that it found money for other things. The Government should launch an educational campaign to help those approaching pensionable age to cope with financial commitments and loans.\nA category of pensioners, who were mainly women, had not amassed enough social security contributions to receive a decent pension. The government had a duty to look after these persons, Dr Farrugia insisted, and they should also be given what they deserved in the upcoming Budget.\nRecently co-opted Opposition MP Kevin Cutajar expressed the Opposition\u2019s approval of the amendments, which would \u201cremedy an injustice.\u201d However, he stated that one could not but worry about pensions in the present day.\nReferring in particular to disability pensions, he asked MPs whether the \u20ac400 or so given to some of those who suffered from disabilities was adequate. Government efforts to increase the employment opportunities offered to the disabled were laudable, but there was a category of disabled persons who would never be able to reach the economic performance necessary to ensure a comfortable life for themselves. As a result, it was necessary to ensure that these persons were given the opportunity to live a decent life.\nDr Cutajar said that other categories, such as the elderly, were failing to benefit from the well-performing economy that the government often mentioned.\nWinding up, Michael Falzon, minister responsible for social policy, said that this year would mark the fourth consecutive increase in pensions since Labour\u2019s accession to government.

Steps were being taken to address this criticism by requiring a public call and selection board composed of experts to be involved in the appointment of the state advocate.\u00a0 \u00a0The Bill would also reduce the powers available to the Attorney General by hiving off his current civil functions.\nFurthermore, Dr Delia was in the same breath proposing to give the Attorney General even more power by urging the government to implement a Venice Commission recommendation to assign magisterial inquiries to the Office of the Attorney General.\nThe present system worked, Dr Bonnici said, and further study was necessary in order to determine whether such a change was warranted and could be implemented.\nReferring to remarks by Opposition MP Carmelo Mifsud Bonnici, Dr Bonnici reiterated that very few jurisdictions in the free world selected their Attorney General - where the latter was also the director of public prosecutions - with a two-thirds majority of Parliament.\nHe could not understand how Dr Mifsud Bonnici had almost encouraged the government to move such legislation while Opposition MPs Simon Busuttil and Karol Aquilina had portrayed the Bill as a \u201cstep back.\u201d Dr Busuttil seemed to be part of the \u201chara-kiri party,\u201d said Dr Bonnici.

However, he said that the government could not introduce all of the changes recommended by the Venice Commission at one go, in order to avoid shocks to Malta\u2019s legal system.\nInstead, changes would be introduced where necessary after the law currently before the House came into force and started to function.

It did not take much to realise that a light carpet that did not stick to the floor in a place used by hundreds of people was not ideal for a bank\u2019s door. Indeed, one of the security officers at the door had long warned of the possible danger, although no other accidents had occurred until that date.\nThe court, therefore, found the bank responsible for the accident through negligence and imprudence.\nIn considering the amount of compensation, the court considered medical expenses incurred by Mrs Seager. It also noted how she had paid her son \u20ac10,000 for the period he looked after her and ordered that that amount be considered as material damages since, had the woman engaged another carer, she would have ended up paying more.\nOn the potential loss of future earnings, the court said that although the woman was 83 years old and was not gainfully occupied at the time of the accident, this did not mean she should not receive compensation for loss of future earnings in view of her 2% permanent disability. \u20ac805.15 were calculated for this purpose.\nThe court therefore ordered the bank to pay total damages of \u20ac11,475.\nMrs Seager was represented by lawyer Malcolm Mifsud.\u00a0", "comment_count": 0, "id": 2314}, {"keywords": "Police", "author": "", "article_body": "A 53-year-old man, Allan Hartmann-Jensen, has been missing since June 5, the police said.\u00a0\nHe was last seen around Bu\u0121ibba square.\nAnyone having information about him is being asked to phone the police, even in confidence, on 21 224001 or 119.\u00a0", "comment_count": 0, "id": 2315}, {"keywords": "Local councils, Politics, Birkirkara", "author": "", "article_body": "Michael Fenech Adami has resigned his seat on Birkirkara local council so that he can continue to serve as president of the Central Region Council, the Nationalist Party said on Monday.\nRecent amendments to local councils law forbids the president of a regional council - grouping councils of neighbouring localities - from being a councillor.\u00a0\nMr Fenech Adami, a former mayor and son of Eddie Fenech Adami, was due to be sworn in for another term as Birkirkara councillor on July 1 after being reelected in elections last month.\u00a0\nBirkirkara is, for the second successive term, to be run by a Labour mayor, Joanne Debono Grech, who was elected with 3,610 votes.\nThe PN's Justin Schembri was the second Birkirkara councillor elected, with 2,543 votes.
