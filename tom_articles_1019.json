What may help the PN this time\u00a0is the fact that Frank Psaila, the mayor\u2019s husband, was an MEP candidate and may have helped raise the turnout among PN voters.

The PD fielded one candidate.\nThe same applies to St Julian's, where the PL fielded four candidates for the nine available seats. AD fielded one, and PD another.\nMeanwhile, in Valletta in 2013, the PN majority was wafer thin at 51.5 per cent. A Labour victory there could see popular One broadcaster Alfred Zammit become mayor.\nSeveral other localities had\u00a0a slim majority for\u00a0both sides.

The Labour majority there was only 50.4%.\n\nMosta and St Paul\u2019s Bay\u00a0are\u00a0traditionally\u00a0battlefield localities.\u00a0Over the past years, St Paul\u2019s Bay\u00a0saw bitter strife within the PN-led council and the government was strong in its criticism of its performance.\nLabour\u00a0will\u00a0be watching Pembroke carefully. It enjoyed a 54.7 per cent majority last time, but the\u00a0controversial\u00a0Db development, which will literally cast part of the locality in shadow, could impact its performance. The smaller parties, in particular, were aggressive in their campaigning in this locality.\nAlso carefully watched by Labour will be Rabat, where the former mayor broke ranks with the party. It is very unlikely that Rabat will swing red, however.\nFloriana could go anywhere. Neither of the big parties won a majority\u00a0there last time, with independents getting a big slice of the vote and effectively\u00a0being king-makers.\u00a0The last mayor came from the Labour\u00a0Party.\nAmong the other localities, the long-serving PN mayor of Iklin has not\u00a0sought\u00a0re-election, seeking election in Lija instead. The PN had a majority of 56.3 per cent here, but there has been controversy in the past years with the council having opposed plans for a by-pass as proposed by the Transport Ministry, despite the streets being clogged by\u00a0north-bound traffic.\nIn Msida, the PN\u2019s majority was just 50.26 per cent although Labour had a majority of seats. Days before the poll, the government produced drawings of a new road design to eliminate traffic congestion there.\nOther localities with thin majorities are\u00a0Pieta\u00a0(PL), San \u0120wann\u00a0(PN), Mtarfa\u00a0(PL)\u00a0and Mellie\u0127a\u00a0(PL) although, given the situation in the PN, the likelihood is that the PL will increase its majorities.\nAn important point to consider is that unlike representation in parliament, representation in the local councils is not decided by the percentage of votes which the parties gain on the first count, but on how many candidates are left standing at the last count. There could \u2013 and have been \u2013 situations where a party wins a majority of votes but ends up with a minority of seats.\nAt the last elections, in half of local councils, in 2015,\u00a0the PN gained votes in almost all the localities in Malta where the elections were held, but it slipped in Gozo.

When he got out of the car, the migrant had run off. Inspector Arnaud points out that their car had been moving at the time the migrant was meant to have kicked their car.\u00a0\n9:33am: Mr Fenech confirms that he and Mr Scicluna occasionally went to \u0126al Far to taunt migrants but not out of spite or hatred but \u201cas a joke\u201d.

The manufacturers claim that they disintegrate but sewage authorities say they break down too slowly and collect congealed fat as they go through the system.\nMonster clogs, sometimes called \u2018fatbergs\u2019, recently caused chaos in places like London and Charleston in South Carolina, with tons of blockages having to be cleared out of the sewers.\nThe cost? \u00a3100 million a year in the UK alone. The water companies say that 80 per cent of the problem comes from wet wipes.\nThe water industry in Britain had conducted tests on the \u2018flushable\u2019 wipes in conditions simulating actual sewer flows \u2013 and all the brands failed to disintegrate. Both sides are now working to try to find products that do not contain plastic and which are more sewer-friendly.\nWet wipes \u2013 both baby and make-up ones \u2013 are a disaster for us as they are clogging up entire areas\nThe corporation has other headaches caused by illegal dumping in the sewage system. Mr Bilocca warned that it was clamping down on abuse: the Discharge Permit Unit carried out 5,193 inspections covering all types of industries in 2018.\nBut what can be done once breaches are identified? They are regulated by what he described as \u201carchaic legislation based on criminal procedures\u201d, so the corporation is proposing a new framework to the government which would make it easier to tackle infringements.\nIt also needs better tools to identify problems in the first place \u2013 ideally before they become a crisis.

When a plant gets blocked, it automatically shuts down, pouring 250 cubic metres an hour of raw sewage into the sea.\nThis happened recently in Gozo, where illegally dumped farm slurry had accumulated in the drains. The system shut down for days, requiring round-the-clock work to clear.\n\u201cIt is no longer difficult to find the culprits. We know the drainage system and know all the tricks.

A.

Because you could crack it up. And cracks are certainly not what you want in an egg if you hope to sell it.\nApart from physical cracks, which is the most direct and obvious way that renders them unsellable, there are other factors affecting Malta\u2019s egg production industry.\nFirst, some numbers to give the sector perspective. According to EU data for April, there were 326,209 laying hens kept in \u2018enriched\u2019 cages in 22 farms across the Maltese islands, 80 free-range chickens on one production site and 9,919 housed in barns on six farms.\nLand-locked Luxembourg \u2013 with a population of some 130,000 more people than Malta \u2013 had a total of 114,000 laying birds distributed among 15 farms.\nClearly, the Maltese like eggs! However, one reason why Luxembourg has so few laying chickens is that it can easily import what it needs from its neighbours. Not so Malta.\nEggs, mostly from Italy, are imported but we rely almost entirely on our local suppliers. \u201cMaltese people prefer local eggs,\u201d states Ballut Farm managing director Clive Vella, and it has little to do with national bias.\nLocal eggs are always fresher, he says. \u201cIf we pick them in the morning they can be in shops by the afternoon or the following day,\u201d explains Vella. Not so with imported eggs.\nNevertheless, many of the big local producers are more concerned about foreign competition than domestic. Geography and costs are the principal reason for this.\nAs islands with no raw materials, Malta\u2019s egg farmers are obliged to \u201cimport everything \u2013 the feed, the machinery, the cartons and plastic packs we sell our eggs in\u201d, says Vella.\nNot only that but more significantly, even the chicks are imported by some egg producers.\n\u201cWe used to have a hatchery, but nowadays every four months we bring between 3,000 and 3,500 one-day-old chicks from Italy,\u201d says Anthony Fenech, co-owner of St Anthony Farm in Qormi.\nBallut Farm also imported pullets from Italy but it now operates its own hatcheries \u2013 one in \u017burrieq and another in the Chadwick Lakes area.\nAt 16 weeks the pullets are transferred to laying farms \u2013 to Mtarfa or G\u0127ajn Tuffieha in Ballut\u2019s case, and from growing sheds to laying sheds in St Anthony\u2019s.\nA slight deviation from the narrative: chickens are known by a variety of names corresponding to their life stages. They are called chicks for the first six to eight weeks after hatching. Females are then known as pullets and males as cockerels.\nThe country may produce just 20 per cent of its food needs but it is self-sufficient in egg production\nAt about 16 to 20 weeks females begin to lay small eggs known as pullet eggs, as they grow older they produce larger ones. It\u2019s not until they\u2019re a year old and fully grown that they\u2019re referred to as hens. An average hen lays between 300 and 325 eggs a year, and in Malta these are categorised as A, B or C and then weight graded. Grade A eggs come in four sizes \u2013 very large (XL) weighing from 73gms upwards, large from 63gms to 72gms, medium from 53gms to 62gms and small for eggs under 53gms.\nNow back to the narrative.\nThe new arrivals at the laying farms \u2013 also known as production sites \u2013 replace hens that are deemed no longer \u2018serviceable\u2019, normally when they reach 16 to 18 months old.\nBallut Farm, the biggest in the country, has a laying flock of some 70,000 birds and every fourth month replaces between 15,000 and 20,000 hens. These produce about 40,000 eggs a day, that\u2019s 14.6 million a year.\nSt Anthony Farm has 15,000 laying 12,000 eggs daily, or 4.32 million annually. Even smaller producers such as Ba\u0127rija\u2019s Golden Yolk Farm with 9,000 hens has an annual \u2018throughput\u2019 of 2.7 million eggs.\nToday the country produces an estimated 109 million eggs a year, not that many more from the 98 million of 10 years ago.\nWith this kind of output local producers ought not to fear foreign competition. But the bigger ones do.\nSome also question why several large supermarkets, which buy up to 90,000 eggs a week from local suppliers, feel the need to stock foreign eggs as well.\nThe country may produce just 20 per cent of its food needs but it is self-sufficient in egg production. So why do egg farmers feel threatened?\nAll agree their overheads are high and profit margins small. They are also concerned at the growing volumes of imported egg products available in shops \u2013 bottles of egg white, \u2018cracked and ready\u2019 packs and tubs of pre-peeled hard-boiled eggs.\nThese convenience items are becoming increasingly popular at some pizzerias, for instance, which buy pre-peeled hard-boiled eggs, and pastry shops which just need the albumen (egg whites).\nUp to now the local producers have not been able to compete with these \u2018foreign novelties\u2019. But one recently set up company has begun to make a dent in this sector.\nSince January AGA Egg Products, a division of St Anthony Farm, has been selling tubs of five pre-peeled hard-boiled eggs.\nThe demand for these kinds of convenience products is growing, says Anthony Fenech, so he and his brother bought machinery that boils and peels eggs.\nUndoubtedly, other egg producers will follow suit and invest in machinery to be able to offer these convenience items and see off the foreign competition.\nUltimately, Malta\u2019s egg producers will need to crack eggs to maintain their market supremacy.\nEgg counter\n\u25a0 Malta produces an estimated 109 million eggs a year, up from 98 million 10 years ago\n\u25a0 An average hen lays between 300 and 325 eggs a year\n\u25a0 Ballut Farm is the biggest in the country, with a laying flock of 70,000 birds\n\u25a0 A population of 336,208 laying hens in the Maltese islands.", "comment_count": 14, "id": 248}, {"keywords": "", "author": "", "article_body": "Two Britons were seriously injured on Sunday when their quadbike was involved in a collision with a Mini Cooper.\nThe police said the accident happened in Triq Is-Salina at about 11.15am.

Photo: Heal and Teach Foundation\nThere seemed little hope that Wubalem Nigatu, who came from a remote village in Ethiopia, would walk properly.\nBut when a relative of hers asked a Maltese man on a trip to Africa whether he could procure some special shoes for her it was not only the spur for her eventual rehabilitation but also for numerous other children like her.\nThe man, Saviour Galea, a 39-year-old accounts teacher, realised that surgical intervention could save the girl from more suffering than a pair of shoes. His assistance to Wubalem eventually led to the setting up of a foundation with another Maltese, Emmanuel Portelli, 66, a retired skilled worker.\nThe Heal and Teach foundation now helps children with disabilities get the simple medical interventions they need.\nThe two men first met in 2013 during a visit to Africa with the late Fr George Grima, who had founded the Jesus in Thy Neighbour missionary movement. The two have been back to Ethiopia and Kenya every year on their own initiative, eventually setting up the foundation inspired by Wubalem.\nTheir first idea was to fly the girl for surgery in Malta but they did not manage. Mr Grima and Mr Portelli then learnt of the Cure Ethiopia Children\u2019s Hospital that was hosting an English surgeon specialised in such conditions.\nOver the past two years Wubalem has been back and forth between her home and the hospital several times.

In Europe, action is usually taken immediately on such cases \u2013 some children would only require something as simple as a plaster cast.\nHowever, in these remote African villages children tend to grow into adulthood with deformities that worsen as they age, often hidden at home by their parents. But following the intervention they even start going to school and other children stop bullying them.\nThe foundation facilitates access to hospitals and this sometimes requires flying them over from one African country to another. It sponsors transport, lodging and meals.\nIn\u00a0Ethiopia, children are seen to at NGO hospitals such as\u00a0Cure Ethiopia Children\u2019s Hospital, Nordic Medical Centre\u00a0and\u00a0Dr Rick Hodes Clinic, where they receive free consultation, X-rays, treatment, surgery and follow-up. In\u00a0Kenya, they are taken to Cure Kenya Children\u2019s\u2019 Hospital\u00a0or\u00a0Tenwek Mission Hospital.\nBut the work of the two Maltese men does not stop here. They introduce children to information technology by making donations to schools of laptops, TVs and educational material.\nThe foundation has also built a school library and kindergarten teachers are introduced to the Montessori teaching methods by Mr Galea.\nVolunteer workers carry out maintenance works.\nMeanwhile, Mr Portelli carries out maintenance at the schools and elsewhere. He recently sealed a well that supplies water to 30 children at a home.\nWhat keeps them going?\nFor Mr Portelli it does not feel as if their work is a drop in the ocean, because helping to change the life of even one child is all worth the effort. He himself spent his childhood at a children\u2019s home and as he grew older he always wanted to give something back to society.\nFor Mr Galea, the results keep him from giving up, especially knowing that all these people lack is money to pay for transport.\nEvery little helps. Mr Galea and Mr Portelli would welcome skilled workers, nurses and doctors to join them, as long as they are committed to the cause.\nDuring their trips they also carry small items of pharmaceutical and medical equipment such as pulse metres and stethoscopes, which they pass on to NGO hospitals and children\u2019s homes.\nMore information about the next trip, or how you could help out, can be found on www.healandteach.org or on the Facebook page called Heal and Teach Foundation.

Misco director Lawrence Zammit, who was closely associated with former Nationalist administrations, has told Newsbook that Adrian Delia should resign given the scale of defeat at the polls.\u00a0\n2.52pm Alex Perici Calascione, who contested the PN leadership in a race which Adrian Delia ultimately won, has added to the rumblings of discontent.\n\"This is the worst electoral result in the PN's history,\" he wrote.\u00a0\"The bigger the electoral gap, the stronger the people's message and the more urgent the need to react to it. Nobody is bigger than the party,\" he wrote.\u00a0\n\"I am ready to play a part,\" he added somewhat cryptically.\u00a0\nNot exactly a ringing endorsement of the party's \"it could have been worse\" post-electoral reaction.\nRead Dr Perici Calascione's post in full.\n2.49pm\u00a0We've had a chat with Dr Farrugia, who delved into the reasons behind his departure in some more detail.\u00a0\n2.27pm Democratic Party leader Godfrey Farrugia is stepping down.\nDr Farrugia says he and the rest of the party's executive committee will resign en masse as the party analyses its electoral performance.\nThe PD got 2.3 per cent of the vote. More than half of the party's 5,276 votes were won by its activist-candidate Camilla Appelgren.\u00a0\nRead more about the PD leader's decision.\n2.20pm PN leader Adrian Delia has pledged to make his party more inclusive and appealing.\nIn a Facebook post, Dr Delia thanked all candidates, elected MEPs and supporters. He took comfort in the fact that the 42,656-vote deficit was better than the initial 72,500-vote defeat forecast by some surveys months ago.\u00a0\nBut he said: \"This result is not what we worked for or hoped to achieve.\"\n\n2.05pm Godfrey Farrugia has confirmed he will resign as leader of the Democratic Party once the local council results are out this week. Story coming up shortly.\n12.50pm\u00a0Malta's registered voter base increased by around 20,000 between each European election - until this one, which saw it rise by closer to 30,000. Another interesting thing to note is the sudden increase in the share of invalid votes. It hovered at around 2 per cent for three successive elections, but was 3.6 per cent for this election.\n\n12.45pm Writing in today's Talking Point on Times of Malta, Deputy Prime Minister Chris Fearne\u00a0gives an overview of the European election results.\nHe says that like his two predecessors, Adrian Delia will be \"arrogantly oblivious\" to the fact that the era of political parties owning votes, let alone voters, has been steadily ebbing away.\nChris Fearne (left) with Joseph Muscat on the party balcony on Sunday.\n12.15pm One year ago, a British-Somali activist who moved to the UK as a refugee became mayor of Sheffield.\u00a0\nNow, he has been elected an MEP.

The MPM's two candidates obtained less than 800 first-count votes between them.\n\n11.05am Amid the internal disgruntlement in the Nationalist Party, the odd public figure is making a statement challenging the status quo. This Facebook post by MP Jason Azzopardi elevates David Casa's electoral success and takes a subtle dig at the party's performance... or is it?\n\n10.18am A look at voting results across EU member states shows that no other party across the 28 member states managed to get the 54.3 per cent Muscat's Labour Party achieved.\u00a0\nThe closest was Viktor Orb\u00e1n's Fidesz, which got just over 52 per cent, followed by Poland's Law and Justice party, which polled 43 per cent.\u00a0\n\n10am Many celebrated when Joseph Muscat announced that the gap between the PL and PN was expected to exceed the 50,000 mark. But perhaps none as much as those who had bet money on the result.\nSources involved in the black market gambling sector tell us bookmakers were accepting wagers on the result being on either side of 50,000 votes in favour of the Labour Party.\n\u201cJust imagine how people jumped when they heard the margin was 55,000, only to be disappointed to later hear they hadn\u2019t won a cent,\u201d a source said.\nBookies were reportedly accepting bets of around \u20ac5,000 and upwards on predictions for the result.\n9.50am\u00a0Miriam Dalli has issued a statement thanking the 63,438 people who voted for her.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"It is not our size that matters but our attitude, our will and the trust in ourselves as one nation,\" she said.\n9.20am Nationalist MP Jason Azzopardi does not mince his words and relishes the re-election of David Casa and Roberta Metsola to the European Parliament.\n\n9.10am Roberta Metsola thanks voters for the overwhelming support.", "comment_count": 284, "id": 256}, {"keywords": "", "author": "", "article_body": "The following are the top stories on Malta's Sunday newspapers.

Those interested in taking part are therefore advised to kindly take note of the revised times on the programme for June below.\nIt has been another happy rambling year for the association during which, fortunately, there were no major hitches and only a couple of cancellations due to inclement weather. Membership continued to grow unabated, as well as the number of non-members joining the weekly walks. The average number of walkers increased substantially to around 70, and it is heartening to encounter more and more ramblers grouped separately to enjoy what is left of the Maltese countryside.\nTo crown it all, this year\u2019s walking tour in Portugal has been extraordinary. RAM exchanged visits with the Clube de Actividades de Ar Livre (CAAL) and 49 Maltese ramblers were treated by CAAL to a fascinating week of activities. And we were all marvelled by sights that will never be forgotten and left open-mouthed by sites we never knew existed.\nG\u0127ajn Tuffie\u0127a\nThe programme was cleverly prepared with interesting cultural visits before and following every walk, so that we gained an insight into medieval Portuguese history and on the role played by the Knights Templar, who were instrumental to evict the Moors from Portugal. While elsewhere the Templars were violently suppressed by the Catholic Church soon after the last crusades, in Portugal they simply took the form of a \u2018new\u2019 military order \u2013 the Order of Christ, with their main seat at the Convento de Cristo in Tomar. This grandoise monastery reflects the evolution of the Templars, with its Romanesque, Gothic, Manueline and Renaissance architecture, and is a Unesco World Heritage Site.\nLastly I take this opportunity to announce that I have stepped down from the position of president of the Ramblers\u2019 Association after 10 years in office, though still remaining a member of the committee. The purpose of stepping down is to make way for younger blood to foster new ideas and vitality within the association. The new president is Ingram Bondin, in whom I and all the other committee members have full confidence. His nomination was unanimously approved.\nKalkara\nJune walks\nAll are welcome to join the walks. Further information can be obtained from the website or by calling the mobile number below.\nSunday, June 2. The Three Cities and Kalkara: A very easy cultural and scenic walk ideal for beginners along the quaint streets of the Three Cities and their coastline as far as the Wied G\u0127ammieq cemetery. This is a circular walk of some four hours starting at Senglea Gate car park at 8.30am.\nSunday, June 9. San \u0120wann, Swieqi and Wied G\u0127omor: Relatively new villages built around old chapels and artefacts are often overlooked, and this easy circular walk will take in prehistoric cart ruts and the old chapel of Santa Magdalena before proceeding to the threatened Wied G\u0127omor. The starting point is opposite the San \u0120wann parish church at 8.30am and lasts about four hours.\nWednesday, June 12. Marsascala and \u017bonqor: A scenic walk along the coast of the village that leads to the shoreline of \u017bonqor and beyond. The moderate walk on rough terrain that will last some three hours, starting from the parvis of the parish church at 4pm.\nSaturday, June 15. \u017bebbug, Tal-Virt\u00f9 and Si\u0121\u0121iewi: Another moderate scenic and cultural walk that lasts about four hours along lovely open countryside with steep uphill and downhill stretches on rough terrain. It will pass by the San Blas chapel, the Buskett foothills and the Laferla Cross. Please note that the walk starts at 7am from in front of the ex-Peridot Hall in \u017bebbu\u0121 (Bus 62, stop: Qirda).\nSunday, June 23. The clay slopes around il-Qarraba: The scenic element will prevail as this walk hugs the waterline from G\u0127ajn Tuffie\u0127a to \u0120nejna, trekking around Il-Qarraba plateau. However, the walk is hard and long, with steep inclines, and participants should have a head for heights. It starts at 7am at the parking lot near the old Riviera Martinque, returning there some four hours later.\nSunday, June 30. The Maritime Museum, the Inquisitor\u2019s Palace and Fort St Angelo: The walking season comes to an end with a guided cultural visit to the three more important historical sites in Vittoriosa, followed with a farewell lunch at a restaurant there. Due to space limitations the number of participants will be restricted, and prior booking, on a first-come, first-served basis will be necessary for the event.

They soon realised that the answer has been with us for millennia: trees! Their thought process then shifted to the local environment and the few spaces where nature is still untouched, such as nature reserves.\nAfter looking at a map of Xemxija Nature Reserve the idea of developing the NRP was sparked. The concept is to protect the nature reserve when it is closed by deploying drone-like robots to inspect designated areas via their GPS locator every time an unauthorised person is sensed in the reserve.\nThe drones would be positioned along a reserve\u2019s perimeter to photograph intruders, and use artificial intelligence to distinguish between humans and animals. Once an image has been captured the drones would return to their charging base which would also be connected to the internet. They would then send the image to the authorities and those responsible for the nature reserve.\nThe team built the NRP prototype using Lego blocks\nThe children also came up with the idea of having a speaker on board the drone to reduce the rotor\u2019s noise by playing instead bird, insect or other animal sounds according to the time of the day and season.\nThe team built the NRP prototype using Lego blocks, a Bluetooth hub with a variable speed motor and a motion sensor. The children had to create a code using programmable blocks on their tablet computer to enable the movement of the rotor, sounds as well as the correct function of the motion sensor.\nThe pupils enthusiastically and voluntarily worked on the project during lessons at school as well as after-school sessions backed by constant support of their mentor, parents and the head of school Mario Mallia. The Malta Robo League judges and visitors to the expo praised the pupils for the originality of their NRP model and the preparation of their \u2018Show Me\u2019 poster.\nThe Malta Robo League is a Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths (STEM) education programme designed for children aged seven to 11, guided by an adult mentor. The league is based on three discovery pillars: identify, design and share. Every stage is discussed, analysed, practised and finally presented as a team.\nNowadays we often hear about the importance of STEM subjects, robotics and coding in our daily life. However, this event stresses the importance of collaboration, creative and abstract thinking, problem solving and innovation, which are the backbone of 21st century skills, as highlighted by various tech giants.\nEducators in the 21st century need to be knowledgeable about how students learn and understand the available resources, including ICT. They also need to embrace change and flexibility of methodology in order to practise differentiated instruction that encompasses distributed learning and evaluation.\nYasmin Galea is an educator at St Albert the Great College.

He previously worked for Foreign Minister Guido de Marco and started his working life as a campaigner for the Union \u0126addiema Mag\u0127qudin.\nIn the last European Parliament term, Mr Casa was head of the PN delegation and coordinator on Employment and Social Affairs for the EPP Group in the European Parliament. He was fiercely critical of the government in EU fora on the rule of law, the government\u2019s handling of the Daphne Caruana Galizia murder investigation and allegations of money laundering, drawing accusations of working against Malta\u2019s interests. He also piloted a proposal for an EU directive for a better work-life balance.\nThis was the first European Parliament term for Alfred Sant, who had ironically led the campaign for Malta not to join the EU. Dr Sant had appeared undecided about seeking re-election before Joseph Muscat publicly urged him to do so. He has since declared this will be his last ever election.\nJoseph Muscat's last political contest?\nAlthough he is not a candidate, this election could also be the last for Dr Muscat \u2013 himself a former MEP - who has led Labour\u2019s campaigning.\nRead:\u00a0Saturday\u2019s election could seal Muscat\u2019s future in the EU\nAfter the last general election, Dr Muscat said he would not seek re-election, fuelling speculation that he would eventually step down and seek a senior EU post. That could very well hinge on how the social-democratic group does in the EP elections.\nWith Dr Muscat possibly on his way out of local politics, MEP Miriam Dalli could well seek to follow his political career path from the EP to local politics (the two also started out as Labour journalists). Her performance on Saturday will therefore be one to watch since a strong result would strengthen her credentials for a party leadership run.\nDr Dalli was also first elected to the European Parliament in 2014 and built a reputation as a very active MEP, successfully campaigning, among other issues, for the EU to set drastic vehicle emission reduction targets.\nWhile Roberta Metsola\u2019s seat appears to be secure, opinion polls have pointed to a battle for the PN\u2019s second and possibly third seat between incumbent David Casa and Frank Psaila, the PN\u2019s former communications director and presenter of Net TVs discussion programme Iswed fuq l-Abjad. This is the first time that Dr Psaila has contested an election, and he was also among the first candidates to launch his campaign.\nRead:\u00a0Labour on track to capture 55 per cent of vote, poll suggests\nPD leader Godfrey Farrugia.\nA survey for The Sunday Times of Malta indicated Miriam Dalli, Alfred Sant, Alex Agius Saliba and Josianne Cutajar as taking the seats for Labour, assuming it wins four seats. That would be a particular disappointment for Cyrus Engerer who for the past years was the prime minister\u2019s representative in the EU and remains his special adviser.\nSaturday\u2019s election will mark the first time that the Democratic Party will officially be on a ballot paper. At the general election it was allied to the PN and its candidates appeared on the PN lists.\nThe PD candidates include party leader Godfrey Farrugia. Should he be elected \u2013 however unlikely \u2013 he would have to choose whether to take up his new seat and give up his seat in the Maltese parliament, or vice versa.\nThis brings up a hypothetical question. Should he give up his Malta parliament seat, and given that he had been elected through a casual election to fill a seat vacated by Beppe Fenech Adami, which party would have the right to co-opt his replacement, the PN or the PD?\nTurnout at the last EP election was 74.8%, four per cent down on 2009, when 78.8 per cent of the electorate turned out to vote.
