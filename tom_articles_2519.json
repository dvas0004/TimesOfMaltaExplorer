Wouldn\u2019t it be better if this surplus is invested in initiatives that will also benefit the government in the long run by bridging the gender gap?\u201d he asked.\nMr Casa was speaking to the Times of Malta as the proposed Work-Life Balance directive, which he led and negotiated \u2013 a first for a Maltese MEP \u2013 awaits a final vote in the European Parliament in April before becoming law.\nDavid Casa\nThe directive would introduce 10 days of paternity leave, remunerated at not less than the national sick pay level, and two months of paid leave for each parent that can be used until the child is eight years old.\nThe aim of the directive was to ensure parents shared the responsibility of their children\u2019s upbringing from the very beginning, Mr Casa said.\nFathers in Malta enjoyed only a single day of birth leave, meaning that if their child was born towards the end of the year and the mother suffered post-natal complications, the father would not be able to lend a hand because he would have probably used up all his leave for the year, Mr Casa noted.\nThe directive has divided opinion, with some saying the 10-day paternity provision is not enough and others questioning the financial burden of increasing paternity leave entitlement.\nMr Casa said his team had tried to find the middle ground as it faced resistance from some employers, who argued this was going too far, while unions insisted it was not enough.\nThough the government needed to consult with businesses and small and medium enterprises, birth leave was a social service, something that was paid up by the State worldwide, he pointed out.\nThe proposed standards were the minimum that would set uniformity across the EU while remuneration was up to the individual member states.\nIn Malta, mothers have 18 weeks of paid leave with a further four months of unpaid leave available for either parent to use. The four-month period was usually used by the mother and Mr Casa noted that their pension suffered as a result since they did not pay national insurance contributions during those particular four months.\nWe shouldn\u2019t look at these rights as an extra expense but as a change in mentality\nApart from introducing 10 days of paid paternity leave, the EU directive would lay down that those four months parental leave would also be paid and made available to parents during their child\u2019s first eight years. This measure would be non-transferrable, meaning that two months have to be taken by the father and another two months by the mother, in consultation with the employer.\nMaternity leave provisions, which are the remit of individual member states, will not be affected by the directive.\n\u201cThis is a small step to start bridging the gender gap, which costs Malta millions of euros each year. Equal parental leave will help start closing the gap as women will continue working and, therefore, making their national insurance contributions,\u201d Mr Casa said.\nLosing a female employee was also a burden on the employer who would have to find a new recruit and provide training.\nThe directive would also introduce the right for employees to request flexible working arrangements and five days of annual leave being granted to workers to care for sick relatives.\nAs with its other provisions, the five-day entitlement was just a minimum condition. In Belgium, for example, rather than five days every year, workers are allowed the equivalent of a whole year in carer\u2019s leave throughout their career, Mr Casa added.\nAnother option would be for the government to accumulate an employee\u2019s carers\u2019 leave over the years so they can use it when they really need it. This would also help governments save money in the long-term, considering that residential and geriatric care was partly-subsidised by the State.\n\u201cThe directive is a good start. I\u2019m convinced that, after a few years, we will start seeing a big positive effect on our economies,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t look at these rights as an extra expense but as a change in mentality.\n\u201cWomen have careers and we need them to remain working as they make an important contribution to societies.

Rarely have real returns been negative across all asset classes in any year and this event happened only twice in the last 25 years. 2018 was also marked by exceptionally volatile equity markets. The S&P 500 plummeted nine per cent in the last month of the year as concerns about recession risk and the future path of interest rate hikes gripped investors \u2212 a stark contrast to the growth exuberance that characterised the start of 2018. December\u2019s performance dragged the S&P 500 into the red for the year, marking the first negative calendar year for US equities since 2008.\u201d\nHe added how: \u201cThe investment strategy of the Mapfre MSV Life with-profits fund is to hold a diversified range of quality assets and currencies that mitigates against market risk. This asset diversification together with the robust investment management process, the quality of the asset managers engaged and the company\u2019s strong track record of investment management give us confidence that the fund will continue to benefit from upturns in investment markets while minimising the negative impact of increased market volatility.\u201d\nThe chief executive officer of Mapfre MSV Life, David G. Curmi, stated: \u201cThe money of our with- profits policyholders is invested in the Mapfre MSV Life with-profits fund. With assets under management of over \u20ac1.89 billion and over 74,000 with-profits plans in force, the Mapfre MSV Life with-profits fund is one of the largest managed savings funds in Malta. The size and strength of our fund allows us to invest in a very wide range of global assets.\n\u201cThe objective of the Mapfre MSV Life with-profits fund is to offer competitive long-term real returns by smoothing the peaks and troughs of day-to-day market movements while at the same time providing an underlying capital guarantee. This means that with- profits investments remain a good choice for investors seeking steady growth from a spread of investments over the longer term with some downside protection. In these uncertain times the benefits of smoothing and guarantees can provide advantages to with-profits policyholders over other forms of investment.\u201d\nMapfre MSV Life plc (C-15722) is authorised by the Malta Financial Services Authority to carry on Long Term Business under the Insurance Business Act, 1998.

Dr Mercieca said localities like Marsalforn had already been ruined through over-development. The solution to too much building was proper planning regulations, he argued.\n\u201cPeople say Gozo will lose its charm with a tunnel. But Gozo is losing its Gozitans, and if it loses those, there will be no Gozo left,\u201d Dr Mercieca concluded.\nHe was followed by another seven speakers who addressed the crowd.\nJoe Muscat from the Gozo Tourism Association said the organisation would be drafting a survey and study to see how the tunnel would impact the sister island\u2019s tourism industry. Would Gozo become a day trip destination? Would Gozo still be a different destination to Malta? Or would it become an add-on for a half-day drive around?\nThe solution to Gozo\u2019s problems, he said, was not a tunnel, but to bring Gozo up to the standard of the mainland.\n\u201cLet us make sure that the tunnel does not become the Brexit of Gozo,\u201d Mr Muscat said.\nIf applause could be a gauge of the audience\u2019s position, then those who gathered in the hall seem to be against the introduction of a tunnel.\nSean Zammit from the Association of Gozitan Employees Working in Malta questioned whether the tunnel was truly intended to address Gozitan workers\u2019 problems.\nWas change necessary? Yes, the current situation was not acceptable, he argued, but a vehicular tunnel was not necessarily the solution.\nThe possibility of improving the existing ferry system through the introduction of a fourth ferry, together with a park and ride system and a fast ferry, were raised.\nWeighing in on fears raised earlier by Dr Mercieca\u00a0about Gozo\u2019s \u201cbrain drain problem\u201d, Mr Zammit said this would be solved by bringing quality jobs to the island and not by digging a tunnel.\nJohn Pace, who used to head Gozo General Hospital, expressed concerns that the tunnel was not a solution to Gozo\u2019s problems. Surely, he said, the existing ferry system could be improved to meet commuters\u2019 needs.\nAnd as for Gozitan students? According to the GUG the majority felt a tunnel would be detrimental to the peace and tranquility of the sister isle - a sentiment that drew appeals from the crowd.\nThat said, waking up at 5am to make an 8am lecture in Malta was also not sustainable.\nSamuel Azzopardi of the Gozitan Regional Committee said the matter had been discussed by Gozo\u2019s mayors during a meeting last month to reach a common position. They agreed that an improved link was not only justified but needed.\nAround 3,000 people have signed a parliamentary petition opposing the planned tunnel, which they claim would cause \u201cirreversible harm\u201d. The petition calls on legislators to prevent the permanent link from being built, warning that the tunnel would bring with it increased traffic, noise and air pollution.\nGovernment plans for a 13-kilometre tunnel running from Manikata to Nadur, which could be completed within five years, have drawn criticism over the effect of increased traffic on the sister island, as well as environmental impacts at the entrance and exit points.\nCritics have also raised concern about the massive amount of construction waste the project would generate and the controversial prospect of land reclamation being presented as the only means of addressing the issue.\nStudies, however, have consistently pointed to high levels of support for the project.\nA Social Impact Assessment carried out by Marvin Formosa in 2017 found that around 82 per cent of Gozitan respondents were in favour of the tunnel, with most citing reduced travelling times between the two islands and the lack of weather-related disruption compared to the ferry.\nA later study by Vincent Marmara for Transport Malta confirmed these conclusions and also found similar levels of support among Maltese people. The vast majority of respondents said they would travel between Malta and Gozo more frequently if the tunnel were to be built.\nAlthough environmental studies are still being carried out, the government has made clear its intentions to forge ahead with the project, with a call for tenders planned to be issued in the coming months.\nPrime Minister Joseph Muscat has said the tunnel would be followed by the introduction of free public transport linking Gozo to the airport, Mater Dei Hospital and other strategic locations across Malta, but has ruled out a rail system.\nA call for offers regarding the Malta-Gozo tunnel project is expected to be published within the few weeks.\nThe government has already submitted plans concerning the project to the EU\u00a0Journal and a\u00a0'Prior Information Notice' was published in the EU\u2019s official gazette of record earlier this year.", "comment_count": 100, "id": 449}, {"keywords": "", "author": "Luke Scicluna", "article_body": "The Opposition would be demanding that the accounts of the Local Enforcement System Agency (LESA) be tabled in the House of Representatives, said MP Robert Cutajar.\nMr Cutajar referred to the LESA reform in negative terms, arguing that local councils had lost the sway that they had once had over where local wardens - now known as community officers - were deployed.

Farmers who go to sell their produce at the market in Ta\u2019 Qali find themselves relying solely on the honesty of the middleman, who is in a position to fix the selling price without being accountable to anyone,\u201d Mr Borg said.\nThe Pitkali market operates on an auction system, where the middleman negotiates with buyers \u2013 hoteliers, supermarkets, grocery stores and the like \u2013 in order to find a price that is acceptable to all.\n\u201cI still meet farmers who tell me that they had an entire box of cauliflowers which was supposedly sold for a grand total of 50 cents. Or, sometimes, they get told that no buyers were found for their produce and it had to be thrown away. There is no way of checking whether this is true or not, as there is no traceability of money and goods.\u201d\nThe unfairness of the situation, Mr Borg continued, was one of the biggest contributors to the dwindling number of farmers.\nWatch:\u00a0\u201cMalta's agriculture will die unless\u2026\u201d\n\u201cFarming is already a very tough job, in and of itself. There are so many variables to contend with, such as weather, climate change problems, nature itself, endless toil... But farmers are used to this, it is not the hardship that discourages them. It is when everything goes well and yet, they are cheated out of a fair selling price.\u201d\nTo further illustrate his point, Mr Borg recounts how a few years back, a strike by the Pitkalija middlemen had caused farmers to sell directly to the buyers. On that occasion, he remembers, they made three times as much money as they would usually have.\nWhat if Malta ends up isolated for a longer time period? We are not equipped to be self-sustainable, and the more time passes the worse it gets\n\u201cNo traceability equals no accountability. Who knows what is happening behind the scenes? The younger ones, especially, start wondering whether this is worth the hard work, if they cannot even make a decent profit when the harvest is good,\u201d he said.\nAsked why no attempts have been made to address the situation, Mr Borg described this as \u201ca mystery\u201d, before going on to say that one of the contributing causes is likely to be the fact that there has never been either organised lobbying, nor political interest.\n\u201cFarming comprises only two per cent of GDP, so the frustration has never really been translated to action.\u201d\nMeanwhile the number of Maltese full-time farmers has been steadily dwindling over the years, with the total number standing at 1,372 as of 2013. In stark contrast, the construction industry is experiencing a long-term boom, with the number of residential building permits issued by the Planning Authority increasing by more than a third in 2015, the sharpest spike in recent years according to most recent statistics.\nRead: 'L-a\u0127\u0127ar bidwi' could be a Maltese reality in 15 years' time\n\u201cIt is a well-known correlation, that when the construction industry is at its strongest, farming is at its weakest, with many farmers who get discouraged opting for one of the many available jobs in construction instead.\n\u201cFarming is dying a slow, agonising death,\u201d Mr Borg said, adding that he personally knew a number of full-time farmers who had invested heavily in their business but who still couldn\u2019t make ends meet and who packed it in to try their luck in the construction sector.\nAsked what would be the ripple effects of the death of the local agriculture industry \u2013 especially bearing in mind that many supermarkets stock fresh produce from Sicily \u2013 Mr Borg reminded me that it does not take a massive natural disaster to remind us that Malta is completely not self-sufficient.\n\u201cAs has happened in the recent past, all it takes is for a couple of days of stormy seas for the ferry connections not to work, resulting in empty supermarket shelves.

Based on this thorough locally-based analysis, the government would be in a much better position to design specific policies that encourage families to have more children.\n\u201cWhile it is good to look at what is working in other countries, it is important to implement a nation-wide study of our own. This is because the determinants of fertility rate may include socio-economic factors that are specific to our country and not others,\u201d explained Dr Fabri, who has specialised in public policy and is a former economist at the Strategic Policy Secretariat within the OPM.\nShe noted that in recent years, there have been several improvements when it comes to childcare services and family-friendly measures. This, Dr Fabri believes, had likely prevented the fertility rate from declining even more.\nThe Eurostat data revealed that the rate in Malta currently stands at 1.26 babies per woman.\nBut despite being the lowest, is the rate actually a reflection of the state of the economy?\n\u201cLow fertility rates are common among developed countries. In fact, the World Population Review report shows that the highest fertility rates are present in developing countries such as Somalia and Niger,\u201d the economist said.\nThere were a number of reasons why a country could be experiencing such low rates, she said. This included interrelated socio-economic elements such as unemployment, uncertain labour market conditions, age at the time of marriage, mean age of women at birth of first child, household income and investment in human capital.\n\u201cThe first two reasons are unlikely to be the situation in the local context given that the economy has not gone through major unemployment or labour market shocks in recent decades. The average age of marriage and mean age of women at birth of first child both increased over the past decade so these elements might be contributing to low fertility rates.\n\u201cWith regard to household income, various studies show that as the average household income rises (a determinant of economic growth), fertility rates decline, especially for middle income households. This is mainly due to the rising costs of raising children which is a factor affecting most countries across Europe, combined with increased investment in children, especially in their education,\u201d Dr Fabri went on to point out.\nOther reasons for lower fertility include self-development involving educational and work commitments. Within this context, the increase of women in Malta\u2019s labour market may also be associated with lower fertility levels due to increased commitments at work.\nDr Fabri said the low rate has a \u201cconsiderable economic impact\u201d on Malta given that the country depends on human capital to generate economic growth.\nLow fertility rates change the composition of the population\n\u201cAs a result, this may lead to significant challenges in achieving reasonable levels of economic growth in the future. In that case, Malta would need large inflows of immigrants. Another important element to mention is that, because low fertility rates change the composition of the population to that of an ageing population, elderly cost care may increase while the tax base declines. This is likely to enhance the vulnerability of the elderly within the economic context.\u201d\nBut is it all bad?\nWhile Dr Fabri believes that there are serious economic implications as a result of low fertility rates, fewer births might not have the significant negative economic implications as many may think.\u00a0\nTechnological advancements such as Artificial Intelligence and automation, for instance, may lead to lower demand for labour to sustain economic growth. However, one needed to interpret this with caution, she added.\n\u201cThere are also arguments in favour of the environment, whereby a less densely populated country is likely to have lower levels of pollution,\u201d she said.", "comment_count": 188, "id": 464}, {"keywords": "", "author": "", "article_body": "The following are the top stories in the newspapers on Monday -\u00a0\nTimes of Malta reports that Spanish investigators have widened their net in the tuna racket probe that involves Malta.\nThe Malta Independent says that concerns about lost open space and the modernisation of the area have been raised following proposals by the American University of Malta for the Dock 1 area in Cospicua.

It deemed action taken by the government as appropriate, as both the consul and the Foreign Minister informed the police about the alleged irregularities.\nThe NAO said the police took action by seeking the views of persons of interest, in particular the consul and the \u201cAlgerian travel agent\u201d, from whom most allegations originated.\n\u201cWhether any other action could have been taken by the government remains subject to debate, conditioned by the context within which the consulate was operating, as well as its operational set up.\n\u201cMoreover, the NAO acknowledges that there were aspects of the allegations beyond the control of the consulate, particularly the involvement of VFS and other agents in the visa process,\u201d the report said.\nThe NAO\u2019s analysis found that 484 of the 6,779, visas issued between March 2014 and September 2015, were not recommended for approval by the immigration police, yet the visas were subsequently approved by the consul.\u00a0\nThe police recommended these visas for refusal because the applicants\u2019 intentions to leave EU territory before the expiry of their visa could not be ascertained and justification for the purpose and conditions of the intended stay was not provided, the report said.\u00a0\nConversely, it was also discovered that there were 865 applications where the police posted no adverse remarks yet the consul refused the issuance of a visa.\u00a0\nE-mail correspondence obtained by the NAO led auditors to \u201cnote\u201d that the consul initially lacked the necessary experience for the running of a consulate.\u00a0\nThe report also revealed that Malta was mentioned in two alerts issued by Frontex about the possible illegal immigration of Algerian nationals and Maltese visas obtained fraudulently in Algiers.\nAccording to the Frontex alerts, Algerian women and children were departing Algiers with a transit through Marseille in France to the final destination in Malta.\u00a0However, their intention was to stay in the EU territory, possibly France, given that at times they only had tickets to Marseille and without money to justify their stay as tourists in Malta.\u00a0\nThe NAO said the investigation of alleged payments to government officials for preferential treatment in the obtaining of visas did not fall within its remit.\njacob.borg@timesofmalta.com", "comment_count": 81, "id": 475}, {"keywords": "", "author": "", "article_body": "The following are the top stories in Malta's newspapers on Sunday.\nThe Sunday Times of Malta interviews the Algerian man who made allegations about irregularities in the granting of Maltese visas in Algeria.\nIt also reports how a Briton has claimed sexual abuse by a priest in Malta several decades ago.\nThe Malta Independent on Sunday interviews the CEO of the Malta Financial Services Authority, who says a new organisational structure will strengthen supervision and governance.

I am sure there were other people who suffered at the hands of this priest and others who have a good impression of him because they did not know what was really happening.\n\u201cI still get flashbacks and nightmares of the abuse,\u201d he said.\nHe describes himself as having been a naughty lad who struggled to abide by rules.\nHis discipline came in the form of the \u2018fish\u2019 \u2013 a stiff piece of leather shaped like a fish used to strike the palm of the hand, usually six times depending on the severity of the offence.\nHowever, this particular priest, he recounted, began asking him to bare his buttocks instead. And that was when the sexual abuse started, taking place in different parts of the school, including the dormitories, the vestibule of the chapel, the washroom and the school secretary\u2019s office.\nFrom when it happened, I started rebelling. I lost interest in education and I distrusted educators\nHe said that one night, at around 9pm, the priest entered the dorm and asked him and a friend to accompany him to rearrange some books in thesecretary\u2019s office.\n\u201cHe was sitting at his desk. I stood a little way away but he told me to come closer as he wasn\u2019t going to hurt me. He asked me to read some passages from a book on his desk. I was nervous and struggled to read.\n\u201cHe put his hand at the base of my back and asked me to try again. While I was reading he moved his hand inside my pyjamas,\u201d he recounted as he went on to describe the sexual abuse in more graphic detail.\nThe priest then told him: \u201cGod will always forgive you\u201d. \u201cHe told me that I must not tell anyone about this and I\u2019d be one of his special boys. He even told me he would do the same to my brother and that God would punish me if I told anyone.\n\u201cHe then left the room and locked me in. He was gone for what seemed like hours but came back and gave me a packet of Bourbon biscuits, which were my favourite,\u201d the man recalled with immense difficulty.\nThe next incident took place a couple of months later in the vestibule of the chapel after the priest invited him to be an altar boy during a Mass he was about to celebrate. The priest caught him sipping Mass wine from the bottle but he did not get angry at him.\nHowever, he later forced him to perform a sexual act on him, saying God was forgiving the boy for what he had done. He then proceeded to celebrate Mass.\nSimilar incidents followed and once the priest penetrated him with his fingers, the man claimed.\nThe abuse, he said, affected him so deeply that he left the school and refused to return.\n\u201cI remember having suicidal thoughts at 12. Why I never did it is something that puzzles me to this day.\n\u201cThe actions of this man changed me. I became a child who always blamed myself for being abused. My mother, father and siblings had to endure some quite horrendous behaviour. I left my schooling with little qualifications and exam results.\n\u201cMy erratic behaviour continued into my late teens when I became a violent young man with many arrests, court appearances and convictions. It was only in my late 20s after a spell in prison that I started to get my life together.\u201d\nHe said compensation was not his \u201cdriving force\u201d for reporting the case. \u201cI cannot live without getting solace and accountability. I want them to investigate and then do the right thing.\u201d\nThe man has a 17-year-old son and a two-year-old daughter from another relationship after the breakdown of his marriage. He said his father never accepted the abuse and never wanted to speak about it up to the day he passed away. His mother, who is 75, still lives with regret for trusting him with the priest.\n\u201cI\u2019m speaking about it because it was recommended I seek closure and to give others the courage to speak up. But I am also doing it for my mum,\u201d the man said, fighting hard to hold back tears.\nmatthew.xuereb@timesofmalta.com", "comment_count": 123, "id": 477}, {"keywords": "Education", "author": "", "article_body": "Last Monday, Commonwealth Day was commemorated at St Margaret College secondary school, Verdala, at a morning assembly addressed by the Queen\u2019s Young Leaders Group and their founder teacher, Martin Azzopardi.

Albeit through different questions, the quest to understand the Universe has been irrevocably entangled with our history and remains an intensely studied topic. This is the field of cosmology.\nBut how do we map out the history of the Universe from the Big Bang to the present? And what is the future of the cosmos?\nThe first major tsunami in cosmology in recent times came in 1998 when two international collaborations were attempting to make precise measurements of how fast the Universe is expanding. They did this using a special kind of exploding star called Type 1A supernovae, which acts as a so-called standard candle at various distances.\nSince these stars act identically across the Universe we can measure how far away they are moving from us. What these teams found startled the whole community. It turns out that the Universe is not only expanding but accelerating in this expansion.\nUp to this point in time, it was fairly universally accepted that the Universe came from an initial Big Bang event that propelled everything in the Universe to move away from each other.\nHowever, given that we always experience gravity to pull things together, it was very unexpected that the Universe would currently be accelerating outward. In fact, both collaborations were awarded the Nobel prize for Physics in 2011.\nThe fact of the accelerating Universe is called dark energy and has been verified numerous times since this first observation.\nTo explain this astonishing discovery, scientists used an old idea by Albert Einstein called the cosmological constant. This entails adding a constant to the Einstein equations for the Universe, which he had initially used in 1917 to describe the Universe as being static. He later abandoned the idea when Edwin Hubble in 1929 found that the Universe is expanding. The idea was resuscitated to explain the 1998 observation of an accelerating Universe. This is now called the standard model of cosmology.\nThe Universe is not only expanding but accelerating in this expansion\nConcurrently, scientists have been working on building space-based satellites to make precision measurements of the early Universe to better test this standard model of cosmology.\nThe first of these missions was called COBE, which confirmed several important features of the Big Bang theory. This was part-led by George Smoot, who won the Nobel prize for these discoveries, and who also opened the Institute of Space Sciences and Astronomy at the University of Malta.\nThe second mission was also run by Nasa, and called WMap. However, the most recent of these missions, Planck, was run by the European Space Agency. The Planck mission was enormously successful in increasing our certainty in many aspects of cosmology, such as the kinds of particles we see in the Universe and the main stages of the early Universe, as well as a better breakdown of the ingredients that make up the Universe. However, it also found a potential problem with our standard cosmological model.\nBy making precise measurements of the early Universe and comparing this with the Type 1A supernovae observations we can test whether the theory gives a consistent picture of the rate of accelerating expansion at present. On this point, the Planck mission found a significant tension between these two observations, which would mean that the standard model of cosmology may need to be slightly modified or potentially entirely redrawn.\nThis observation has led to a reinvigorated examination of Einstein\u2019s theory of gravity and potential alternatives that may better explain the evolution of the Universe, and the role of dark matter in galaxies.\n\u2018Understanding the Universe\u2019 public conference\nLeading figures in the cosmology community are meeting in Malta this week to discuss potential paths to reviewing the standard model of cosmology and discuss other issues in current cosmological models.\nGiven the strong public interest in this work, a public conference entitled \u2018Cosmology@Malta 2019: Understanding the Universe\u2019 is being held at the University of Malta\u2019s Valletta campus on Thursday at 7pm.\nTwo of the speakers, Prof. Mariam Bouhmadi Lopez from the University of Bilbao, Spain, and Prof. Emmanuel Saridakis from the National Technical University of Athens, Greece, will discuss our current understanding of the Universe and outstanding problems that the community is working on.\nThe event is being held by the University of Malta\u2019s Institute of Space Sciences and Astronomy in collaboration with the Faculty of Science and Malta Caf\u00e9 Scientifique.\nAdmission is free but registration is mandatory as space is limited.

During a series of interviews, Times of Malta found that the majority of students intend to vote in the upcoming European Parliament elections, although some believe they are not informed enough to do so. Moreover, the majority of students interviewed said people should exercise their right to vote, while others identified certain conditions that should be met before youths can cast a well-informed vote.\nOne of the pertinent issues that students feel Europeans are currently faced with is migration. Some interviewees said the distribution of migrants across the EU countries should be addressed by the MEPs elected in the upcoming elections, while others added there should be more tolerance to diversity within Europe.\nFor one Junior College student, the fact that Brexit is looming without the UK having finalised its terms of exit from the European Union was a worrisome subject. Another important issue cited by several students was the global environmental threat of climate change.\n\u201cI feel like we\u2019re not doing enough to help the environment,\u201d said one student, adding that this is one of the most important things that MEPs should be aiming to tackle. Students also said that over-construction and the lack of walking and cycling passages could be changed by the elected MEPs.\nOther students at the University of Malta said that gender equality is an area they think MEPs should be addressing. This includes pushing for women\u2019s rights, equal pay and encouraging more women to enter into politics.\nWhen asked what values the MEPs \u2013 who will be acting as their voice for the coming five years \u2013 should possess, replies varied. One respondent said: \u201cThey should be willing to listen to different opinions, not only from other politicians, but also from working professionals, such as scientists in the case of climate change.\u201d\nAnother student added he would like to see Malta\u2019s representatives at the European Parliament putting Malta first. Compassion, level-headedness and a positive way of thinking and approaching discussions with other countries were also given importance.\nThe act of voting is regarded not just as a right, but as a duty by many students. Voting is an integral part of the democratic process and students feel that members of society should be engaging in this act in a conscious and informed manner.\n\u201cIf they have a right, they should go and vote because we have to decide what we want for our future,\u201d said one of the students. Others also highlighted the importance of voicing your opinion and taking responsibility for the future of Europe through this democratic act.\n\u2018The EU is about balance\u2019\nMark Harwood, director of the Institute for European Studies, University of\u00a0Malta\nMalta enters the 2019 European Elections as an anomaly of sorts. We are a small State on the periphery of Europe, far from Brussels with limited potential to ensure our voice is heard in a union of 500 million people and yet we are one of the most informed and fully engaged countries in the EU. In previous European Parliament elections we registered the highest turnout of any country where voting is not obligatory and there is little to suspect that we will not repeat this high turnout on May 25.\nFrom the interviews undertaken with students, it\u2019s encouraging to see young people engaging with the elections and articulating their concerns. Many of the issues they highlight, including migration and the environment have been perennial concerns of the Maltese as expressed in Eurobarometer surveys throughout the years. In terms of Brexit and the gender gap, these are issues which appear to be a growing concern, both locally and abroad.\nHowever, while many people look to the EU to solve national problems, the EU does not always have the right to involve itself in certain matters, like taxation, social policy or culture. In these and other areas, the member states wish to maintain their control and exclude the EU from significant involvement. This has been seen clearly in the area of irregular migration where the EU has limited competence and where the member states differ on how to tackle irregular migration flows.\nThis has not stopped the EU from trying to help share the burden of irregular migration on entry-point countries but the scheme is voluntary and based on solidarity among the member states with some countries refusing to participate.\nThe same can be said for the environment. The EU is a global leader in combatting climate change but its environmental policy does not stretch to issues like over-construction or cycling paths. These issues belong to the national government and it is national politicians who must address the issue. This does not stop the EU from encouraging the use of more environmentally friendly modes of transport, such as cycling, through the financing of projects such as the EuroVelo 8 which creates a cycle route across the northern Mediterranean, but the EU cannot dictate to Malta the need for more infrastructure for cyclists.\nIn terms of gender-based inequality, the EU has fought discrimination for decades and has sought to promote gender equality, even within its own institutions, trying to ensure gender balance within the College of Commissioners as well as with long-term plans for strategic engagement for gender equality in the Union. However, the European Commission is often restricted in what it can do in this area to raising awareness, encouraging reforms and facilitating learning among the member states.\nUltimately the EU is about balance, doing things at the appropriate level. If an issue is tackled best at the national level, it should be dealt with by the individual member states and much of the reforms needed in Malta on gender equality will have to come from our politicians and not the EU, but the EU can point the way.\nTherefore, as we move towards the elections it is heartening to see high levels of engagement among our voters and the hope will be that the more engaged voters encourage all those around them to vote on May 25.\nA service brought to you by the European Parliament Office in Malta.", "comment_count": 2, "id": 498}, {"keywords": "", "author": "Philip Leone Ganado", "article_body": "Malta will increase its focus on solar energy under a new 2030 plan though development policies and lack of available land could hamper the shift.\nThe draft National Energy and Climate Plan, newly published for public consultation, lays out the government\u2019s strategy for the next decade under the EU\u2019s long-term climate goals and Paris Agreement commitments.\nIt lays out key objectives for Malta of a 19% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and a 13% share of renewable energy in final energy consumption by 2030.\nBuilding on a move towards solar energy generation in the current renewable energy plan, the draft document includes extensions on measures to incentivise large-scale solar farms and rooftop photovoltaic panels.
