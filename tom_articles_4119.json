On Wednesday, Dr Fenech told the court how Mr Mostafa had sutured perforations in the patient's intestine and worked to stem the bleeding.\u00a0\nDr Fenech was testifying in the compilation of evidence against Bojan Cmelik, who stands accused of having murdered Mr Chetcuti by stabbing him in Paceville.\nIn previous sittings, the court had heard from pathologists who examined Mr Chetcuti\u2019s body, police officers who were at the scene of the crime and forensic specialists who examined the suspected murder weapon.\nMr Cmelik sat silently, armed guards nearby, as Magistrate Marse Ann Farrugia began the day's proceedings before a packed courtroom.\u00a0\nDr Fenech explained how, having sutured the perforations, they had then flushed the patient\u2019s abdomen with large amounts of water and checked the intestines several times to ensure there was no further damage.\nJunior trainee Stefan Zammit, who followed Dr Fenech on the witness stand, testified to this. Though both witnesses remembered two drains being inserted into Mr Chetcuti following the intervention, neither could recall who had inserted them. A third witness, consultant pathologist Darko Babic, explained how he had been given two intestine samples following the surgical intervention to examine. Dr Babic noted a significant perforation and evidence of haemorrhaging in the larger sample but nothing especially concerning in the smaller one. When asked what caused the haemorrhage, Dr Babic said he could not say.\n\u201cI can only comment on the specimen,\u201d he told the court. \u201cIt would be unfair to anticipate wrongly\u201d. The case continues on January 23.\nFlowers in tribute to Hugo Chetcuti outside one of his Paceville establishments.\nMinute-by-minute blog\n1.56pm And that's it for today's hearing. Magistrate Farrugia adjourns proceedings to January 23.\u00a0\n1.53pm Lawyer Joe Giglio wants to know what caused a haemorrhage Dr Babic noted in the larger specimen.\n\"I cannot say,\" the doctor replies. \"I can only comment on the specimen\". It would be unfair of him to speculate, he explains.\u00a0\n1.50pm The problem with the longer intestine sample, the doctor says, was the perforation causing peritonitis. That (thank you, Google) is an \"inflammation of the peritoneum, typically caused by bacterial infection either via the blood or after rupture of an abdominal organ.\"\nThere was nothing in the shorter piece that could cause acute problems, he says.\u00a0\n1.44pm The consultant is delving into details of his findings, and it's getting fairly dense for those without medical training. There's talk of acute inflammations, superficial lacerations and trans mural defects.\u00a0\n1.40pm His hystological report confirmed what a visual examination indicated, Dr Babic tells the court. There were signs of inflammation.\n1.35pm\u00a0Dr Babic is now explaining his duties in such situations. All tissues removed from a patient during surgery must be analysed. A report into the findings is then put together. The head of department is roped in to examine specimen which are interesting or unusual.\u00a0\nIn Mr Chetcuti's case, two pieces of bowel were removed and assessed under a microscope.\u00a0\n1.31pm\u00a0Dr Zammit is done testifying. The day's third witness is Darko Babic, a consultant pathologist.\nDr Babic says he has been a consultant since 2002 and worked in Malta since 2009.\u00a0\nHe was not involved in the operation on Mr Chetcuti, but checked a specimen of his bowel - a regular procedure following such surgeries.\u00a0\u00a0\n1.27pm\u00a0He recalled how the patient's abdomen had been flushed several times and then checked time and time again .\u00a0\n\"I had a very limited view,\" Dr Zammit says, explaining how he was to the side.\u00a0\nHe also recalls two drains being inserted and the abdomen being closed. There was mention of the patient being in a much more stable condition, he says.\u00a0\nAnswering questions from Dr Psaila, Dr Zammit says he too does not recall who inserted the drains, but that it was not himself.\u00a0\n1.22pm Dr Zammit recalls how he was summoned to help and immediately did so. He had not seen the patient or asked any questions about him and did not know any details about the case.\u00a0\nWhen he entered, the surgeon and Dr Fenech had just controlled the bleeding, he says.\u00a0\n1.20pm Another doctor, Stefan Zammit, is the next witness.\u00a0\nDr Zammit was the other medic present during the surgical intervention. He tells the court that he graduated as a doctor four years ago.\u00a0\n1.17pm Defence lawyer Dr Psaila wants to know how many doctors were present during the operation. The surgeon, a basic trainee and himself, Dr Fenech replies.\u00a0\n1.11pm\u00a0With that done, they proceeded to wash out the abdomen. Two drains were inserted - Dr Fenech can't recall by who - and Mr Mostafa closed the victim's abdomen with his help, he tells the court.\u00a0\nWith that done, Mr Chetcuti was transferred to the hospital's intensive treatment unit.\u00a0\u00a0\n1.06pm\u00a0They found four perforations of Mr Chetcuti's small intestine, he tells the court. Mr Mostafa sutured them all and checked them several times to exclude any further damage.\u00a0\nMr Mostafa then checked both the small and large intestines, physically going through their full length to make sure nowhere else had been pierced or ruptured. Dr Fenech says he served as an extra pair of eyes and hands at this stage.\u00a0\n1.04pm\u00a0Once the mesentry had been stitched up, much of the blood loss stopped, he tells the court.\u00a0\nWith that done, they proceeded to check for damage to other organs.\u00a0\n1.01pm Dr Fenech recalls that parts of Mr Chetcuti's small intestine had been affected by the injury and that there were \"huge amounts of blood\".\u00a0\nMr Mustafa had sutured the mesentry -\u00a0a fold of membrane that attaches the intestine to the abdominal wall.\nHugo Chetcuti was murdered in Paceville.\n12.57pm\u00a0The magistrate wants to clarify what Mr Fenech's precise role was throughout the surgical intervention.\u00a0\nHe explains that it was Mr Mostafa who took final decisions, but that he could take initiatives to help the operating surgeon.\u00a0\nIn this particular case though, he says he cannot recall what he did specifically. It must have been the usual sort of assistance, he tells the court - cutting out extra threads during suturing, sucking out blood, helping the surgeon see better by moving organs as he worked, disinfecting areas and so on.\u00a0 \u00a0\n12.53pm Surgical trainee Jeremy Fenech is the day's first witness. He tells the court he graduated five years ago and sees to emergency cases. He was assisting during surgery on Mr Chetcuti. Surgeon Ayman Mostafa was the doctor who first operated on Mr Chetcuti when he was rushed to Mater Dei following the stabbing.\u00a0\n12.50pm Magistrate Marse Ann Farrugia begins proceedings. As a reminder - lawyer Ishmael Psaila is representing Mr Cmelik, with Inspector Nikolai Sant prosecuting and lawyer Joe Giglio appearing parte civile on the Chetcuti family's behalf.\nBefore last October's hearing had to be put off, the court had heard how Mr Cmelik used to go by another name - Bojan\u00a0Mitic. He had his name changed in March 2016, police officers testified.\u00a0\n12.45pm Mr Cmelik is in the courtroom, with armed guards standing close by.\u00a0\nTensions have run high in this case. Last October, a hearing had to be postponed after a bit of a kerfuffle in the courtroom. Mr Chetcuti's brother-in-law had lunged at the accused, saying his \"smirks\" had infuriated him.\u00a0\n12.35pm\u00a0It's looking like a packed courtroom, and people will be jostling to get a seat. Not entirely surprising, given that Mr Chetcuti's murder was arguably the highest-profile crime of 2018.\u00a0\n12.30pm Armed officers are in the corridor outside the courtroom, as has been the norm throughout the case. Mr Chetcuti's brother is also present.\nThe hearing prior to this one was over almost as soon as it began. Will Wednesday's shed more light on the case?\u00a0\n12.25pm\u00a0Three doctors who formed part of the medical team caring for Mr Chetcuti in the days before his death are expected to testify today.\nThe court has already heard from other medics in previous hearings. They told the court that Mr Chetcuti was rushed into surgery 21 minutes after entering hospital, and had initially appeared to be in a stable condition following that intervention.\u00a0\nHis condition however subsequently deteriorated and he died a few days later.\u00a0\n\u00a0", "comment_count": 0, "id": 3248}, {"keywords": "", "author": "Sarah Carabott", "article_body": "Updated at 6pm with UNHCR statement\nTired and weary but ecstatic, 49 men, women and children walked on land on Wednesday afternoon after a long journey at sea which saw them finally reaching Malta.\nThe migrants, who will be shared with Germany, France, Portugal, Ireland, Romania, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Italy, spent 19 days aboard two NGO rescue ships.\nThey were refused entry first by Italy - which was legally bound to allow them in - and then by Malta until Wednesday, when an agreement was finally reached on the distribution deal.\nAs part of the relocation deal, a majority of a separate group of 249 migrants brought to Malta by AFM patrol boats in December will also be taken to other EU countries.\u00a0\nThe agreement was announced by Prime Minister Joseph Muscat and welcomed by opposing politicians, NGOs, Bishops, the UNHCR and Council of Europe, among others.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"220 persons will be relocated to other member states or be returned to their county of origin,\" Dr Muscat said.\nChristmas rescues\n\nMost of the group of 49 migrants, including women and young children, were rescued by the MV Sea-Watch 3 three days before Christmas.\nOthers were picked up by the MV Sea Eye.

She said he would tap her hand to signal his intentions.\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell your mother or aunt?\u201d the judge continued, prompting the girl to insist that courage had failed her and that she did not want to cause a family breakup, which was what actually happened ever since her disclosures.\nAfter recounting in detail the instances of abuse leading to the accusations against her cousin, when asked by the Judge whether she had herself made sexual advances towards her cousin, the girl\u2019s first reaction was \u201cI don\u2019t remember.\u201d\nUrged by the judge to tell the whole truth, the girl continued:\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what came over me that time. I dropped a hint and he touched my private parts. Then I regretted it.\u201d\nQuestioned about her relations with her former and current boyfriends, the girl stressed that she had done none of the things she had experienced with her cousin.\nThe witness explained how she had once confided in her former boyfriend, opening up about her longstanding troubles. It was he who had urged her to speak out about the abuse.\n\u201cIs this the truth?\u201d asked the judge. \u201cYes\u201d came the firm reply. \u201cDo you want to take anything back?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d the girl concluded.\n\u201cIt was not easy to talk the first time.

Ramona Depares speaks to three political observers who believe it would not be the right move, one of them insisting no one is strong enough to take over.\nAs clouds continue to gather around embattled Nationalist Party leader Adrian Delia, the voices of those who question whether a political future as head of the Opposition remains viable for the lawyer-turned-politician grow increasingly louder.\nIt is an unprecedented situation for Malta\u2019s second biggest political party, which historically has opted for a \u2018Caesar\u2019s wife\u2019 approach when it comes to decisions about its leadership.\nWhile past PN figureheads like Eddie Fenech Adami and Guido de Marco achieved a near cult-like status and the unquestioning loyalty of party supporters, an internal party rift has been caused by events surrounding Dr Delia\u2019s personal and professional life.\u00a0\u00a0\nWe asked three political observers for their take on the impasse, and what they believe should be the way forward for Dr Delia.\n\n\u2018No one is strong enough to pick up the reins\u2019\nGeorge Vital Zammit\nLecturer in the Department of Public Policy, University of Malta\n\u201cIt is easy to make a call for the resignation of a party leader, but things do not happen in a vacuum. Were Dr Delia to resign at this point, political affairs in the country will not suspend themselves until the Nationalist party resolves its internal affairs and appoints a new leader.\nThe previous PN leader, Simon Busuttil, made the choice to step down after the Nationalist Party lost the second election in a row under his watch.\nHis decision to make way for a new leader was met with criticism from sections within the party. Many were those who felt that this course of action meant that Dr Busuttil was abandoning the party at a time when it needed him most, and without a clear way forward.\nWhen Laurence Gonzi decided to renounce his leadership, his strategy was very different. He took an active part in paving the way for a new leadership. This is because the resignation of the leader of the Nationalist Party comes with very strong implications. It is the second biggest political party in Malta, and a resignation effectively means that Malta could be left without an effective Opposition. At the end of his tenure, Dr Gonzi ensured that this scenario did not happen.\nWe need to ask ourselves what would happen were Dr Delia to resign. At this stage I do not believe that there is anyone within the Nationalist Party who is strong enough and who possesses the right skills to pick up the reins. And, as a main political player, Dr Delia cannot simply step down and leave a vacuum.\nIf you had a strong contender for the PN leadership, then a different set of considerations would come into play. But at the moment this is not the case. You could say the situation is in stark contrast to that within the Labour Party, which has invested in young people who have the potential to become promising leaders. We have a number of Cabinet ministers who are still in their 30s, and who could take up the top role within the party.\nIt is clear that Labour has laid down a succession plan, while the PN has not, which makes a sudden resignation possibly counterproductive. The situation is far from ideal and Dr Delia needs to resolve the issues that surround his leadership as rapidly as possible. I cannot envisage a situation panning out where he is leading an election with all these questions hanging over his head.\nI view the 2019 elections as a litmus test for the upper hierarchy of the Nationalist Party. This is why it is of paramount importance that all issues are resolved.\nBut, in the meantime, Malta\u2019s government needs an effective Opposition leader to watch over the executive. Malta does not stop functioning while a political party sorts out its internal affairs.\u201d\n\n\u2018Separation cases are notoriously complicated\u2019\nLaurence Grech\nFormer editor, The Sunday Times of Malta\n\u201cIf any of the allegations that have been brought forward against Dr Delia were to be proven in court, then without a doubt his position would be untenable. However, this is not the case so far. I myself have not seen any shred of evidence regarding domestic abuse or any other allegations.\nShould a political leader resign on the strength of unproven allegations? I do not believe so. It is very easy to make an allegation; anyone can decide to fabricate an accusation against anyone. In this case, what if the allegations turn out to be unfounded? Separation cases are notoriously complicated, and there have been instances where spouses were found to have made exaggerated claims.\nIt is also worth noting that over the years many allegations covering a wide variety of issues have been made against many politicians from across all sides of the political spectrum. None of these allegations have ever led to resignations.\nI do not believe that Dr Delia should be expected to resign on the strength of unproven stories\nIf the accusations that have been made with respect to Dr Delia are ever corroborated by a court of law, then there is no doubt that he will not be able to stay on as party leader. You cannot have one of Malta\u2019s main political players tainted in this manner. But until then, I do not believe that Dr Delia should be expected to resign on the strength of unproven stories.\u201d\n\n\u2018George Borg Olivier soldiered on\u2019\nDominic Fenech\nProfessor of History, Dean of the Faculty of Arts at University of Malta\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think he should resign, and certainly not on the basis of snippets of family life that have been evidently leaked with a purpose. Those who are baying for his resignation have been wanting to get rid of him ever since his name appeared in the PN leadership contest.\nIf it were not his family affairs, they would be waiting for some other handle. After all, it\u2019s not so long ago that his wife was being rubbished on the most personal and private level for no other reason than that she was his wife.\nHis political rivals have already shown a capacity to stop at nothing to achieve their aims, just as they did not stop after he trounced them in the leadership race. Let\u2019s face it, this is the first time in 70 years that a losing faction in a party leadership contest has openly failed to accept the outcome, threatening every day to split their own party.\nI would say, if he has the wherewithal to absolve his political responsibilities while going through personally trying times, then there\u2019s no cause for resignation. George Borg Olivier soldiered on when his marriage broke down under what were, for those times, very damaging circumstances.\u201d\nCourting controversy\nThis is not the first time that Adrian Delia has courted controversy and provoked antagonism.

This could pave the way for the exit of another senior Labour politician, possibly Equality Minister Helena Dalli.\nAdrian Delia and the PN\u2019s future\nIf he lasts that long, the May elections could be do or die for Adrian Delia, after less than two years at the helm of the party. While it is an open secret that he does not enjoy the full support of party members, a bad showing in next May\u2019s election would erode his position even further and boost calls for him to resign.\nEducation Minister Evarist Bartolo has already been linked with the presidency\nUnfortunately for Dr Delia, scepticism over his political future does not only relate to his leadership qualities: questions have been raised about his integrity and personal life. Having started on the wrong foot from the very moment he entered the PN leadership race in the summer of 2017 \u2013 when he had to battle money laundering claims by slain journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia \u2013 he is still facing questions. While Dr Delia has strenuously denied any wrongdoing, the recent revelation by this newspaper that he is under police investigation over the matter has started to dent his credibility even among his most ardent followers.\nAs if this was not enough, the PN leader is also facing calls to resign over domestic violence claims, levelled over the Christmas period by his estranged wife Nickie Vella de Fremaux.\nMany, even from within the PN, are of the opinion that a political party whose leader is constantly having to fight fires on various fronts stands no chance at the polls, even more so in the PN\u2019s dire situation. Yet, Dr Delia is resolute about forging ahead.\nIronically, the dim prospects for May\u2019s elections seem to have turned in his favour as it has so far discouraged any serious contender for the leadership from coming forward. However, the escalation of issues surrounding his marital breakdown has made the situation very volatile.\nWith senior PN officials admitting that the party is no longer functioning, it may not be long before the issue comes to a head. If not, Delia will have the daunting task of achieving the seemingly impossible: making inroads into Labour\u2019s commanding lead in May. Or find himself in even hotter water.\nMEP and council elections\nThe political highlight of the year is expected to be the European and council elections scheduled for May 25.\nNormally, expectations for the party in government in democratic countries would not be very high, as mid-term elections usually result in some losses and are more about damage limitation than anything else. However, Malta seems to be an exception, as every single opinion poll carried out since the 2017 general election indicates that the PL could well widen the already huge gap between the two main parties. While Prime Minister Joseph Muscat has been trying to play the underdog card, it is more than plausible that his party will win four out of the six European Parliament seats up for grabs, as things stand.\nWhile such a result would be another feather in Dr Muscat\u2019s cap, it would further diminish the Nationalist Party\u2019s electoral prospects, at least for the immediate future. It would mean that despite having changed leaders twice, the PN has made no inroads after six years in Opposition.\nIs it curtains for Opposition Leader Adrian Delia (left) and Prime Minister Joseph Muscat this year? Or will they both still be around in 2020?\nIs the PM still intent on calling it a day?\nIronically, a convincing result for the Labour Party could also result in Joseph Muscat bowing out of politics. Having repeatedly declared he has no intention of contesting the next general election, there would be no better time to pass on the baton than with his party enjoying more popularity than ever. Yet, he is still facing calls to stay on, sometimes publicly, as was the recent case of his predecessor Alfred Sant.\nShould Dr Muscat resign, a hotly contested leadership race is on the cards. While one of the expected contenders, Deputy Prime Minister Chris Fearne, would appeal to the moderate faction, Transport Minister Ian Borg is also touted to be strongly interested in the position and his stock with the grassroots is rising. However, as the saying goes, where two are fighting, the third wins, which in this case could spell good news for another potential contender, MEP Miriam Dalli.\nCorruption \u2013 17 Black, Macbridge\n2018 was the year in which Joseph Muscat claimed victory in the Egrant saga, as a magisterial inquiry concluded there was not enough evidence to support claims that he or his wife Michelle owned this secret Panama company.\nYet, the government\u2019s reputation of bad governance and corruption suffered another blow in November when damning evidence emerged involving Minister Konrad Mizzi and the Prime Minister\u2019s chief of staff Keith Schembri. The Times of Malta and Reuters revealed that the owner of Dubai-based company 17 Black \u2013 which planned to deposit $2 million in the accounts of secret Panama companies owned by Mr Schembri and Mr Mizzi \u2013 was Yorgen Fenech, the chairman of the consortium chosen by the government to build the new power plant in Delimara.\nThe link prompted even more calls for the Prime Minister to take action, given that Mr Schembri and Mr Mizzi, who deny any wrongdoing, persistently refuse to consider stepping down.\u00a0\nLabour\u2019s already weak reputation for fighting corruption would be further eroded\nHowever, there could be more dark clouds on the horizon. Apart from 17 Black, leaked emails uncovered in this joint investigation by Times of Malta and Reuters showed that there was also another company by the name of Macbridge, which was also identified as a source of funds for the companies owned by Mr Schembri and Mr Mizzi.\nThe identity of Macbridge\u2019s owner has not yet been established. However, if it were to be somehow linked to the power station project or any other member of government, Labour\u2019s already weak reputation for fighting corruption would be further eroded. In the hypothetical scenario of this happening following Dr Muscat\u2019s departure, it would not bode well for Mr Mizzi because the Prime Minister, who has been a staunch defender of his, would no longer have the final say.\nMeanwhile, three other pending inquiries could have very serious repercussions for Labour. These relate to allegations that Mr Schembri received kickbacks from the sale of passports, another that involves him and former Allied Newspapers managing director Adrian Hillman in money laundering claims, and a third into Panama Papers revelations. The latter is yet to start due to legal challenges mounted by the \u2018defendants\u2019, including Mr Schembri, who objected to this probe taking place.\nThis year will also mark the second anniversary from the assassination of journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia.

Writing as someone who has lived both sides of the coin \u2013 I was born and raised in Valletta and, to a limited extent, I also appreciate the new life the last decade brought with it \u2013 the outcome of the so-called \u2018regeneration\u2019 is both obvious and inevitable.\nValletta appears to be on a fast-track to becoming a cold and soulless city, populated only by revellers and an ever-changing parade of anonymous residents.\nAnd, although the influx of new residents includes a small number of young families, these have very little opportunities to bond with the original community of Beltin that is dying out fast.\nEven the shortest chat with a few of the original families is likely to yield a refrain repeated across the corners of the city. From l-Ar\u010bipierku across to il-Kamrata, id-Diju Balli, Puturjal and il-Mandra\u0121\u0121, the few remaining resident families are likely to disagree on everything, from which political candidate they support to which patron saint\u2019s xalata to attend.\nBut, on one point, they will nod in agreement: the Beltin are no longer wanted in their own city.\nThis is a point that Holger Camilleri, 33 years old and hailing from one of the original families of Valletta, has discussed at length with friends and family. He has seen Valletta change to a more commercial city over the last three decades, and believes that this has been achieved at the expense of \u201ckicking aside its soul \u2013 the residential part\u201d.\nToday, Valletta is alive and buzzing, but nobody seems to actually live in the city\n\u201cWe expect evolution to take us to a better place from all aspects, but in Valletta it started and stopped with the commercial side. We have not seen it happen from a residential perspective. Business owners and developers need to keep in mind the families that kept the heart of Valletta beating through the years,\u201d he says.\nThis lack of respect towards the original communities is a story that has repeated itself across many cities across Europe.\nSt Zachary Street, June 2009\nIn London, residents of Shoreditch, Hackney and Brixton found themselves priced out of their homes during a regeneration process that took place between 2004 and 2015.\nToday, these areas are major tourist hubs. But, while they are no longer classed among the poorest areas in London, the flipside is that local residents and traders have been pushed out of their homes and communities.\n\u201cI do believe that the intentions behind the changes are good, but there needs to be a properly enforced plan to conserve the character of the city. If residents were to be consulted, the change will be for the better, as it will touch the soul of the city. Valletta is made by its people,\u201d Mr Camilleri concludes.\nArtist James Vella Clark is another Belti who concedes he has witnessed a number of positive developments \u2013 he mentions the restoration of buildings, the rediscovery of the city and the influx of new people.\nBut he remains also wary about the commercial aspect gaining the upper hand when it comes to prioritising strategies.\n\u201cThere is a renewed sense of pride among the newer generation of residents. But this constantly clashes with the many business interests. There is no balance between the needs of the residents and the influx of so many cars, businesses, tourists and leisure seekers.\n\u201cValletta\u2019s needs are unique, because it is the administrative city and it\u2019s the heart of tourism activity. Residents have to co-exist with all this. There are moments when I feel too stifled. Valletta has been reduced to a cash cow,\u201d he laments.\nAnd, while he does not believe that the community of people is dying, he does feel that the community spirit is dying.\nSt Christopher Street, September 1998\n\u201cThe demographics have changed so much, in such a short span of time within a confined locality. The culture clash between the old community and the newer one is even more evident now. When such a cultural divide exists, it is very difficult to aspire to a sense of unified community,\u201dMr Vella Clark says, adding that although all localities experience this in some way, in a small community such as Valletta this is more evident.\nMuch like everyone I speak to, photographer David Pisani \u2013\u00a0 who is currently exhibiting a collection of 192 works that make up a visual documentation of the city \u2013 recognises the need of a living city to evolve.\nBut, he says, this should not be at the expense of the community that lies at its heart.\n\u201cChange in any city is both inevitable and desireable. In the case of Valletta, the infrastructure was crumbling and the residents were slowly leaving. This was the point where a surge of restoration projects began,\u201d he points out.\nHowever, he believes that not enough was done to stop residents from leaving.\n\u201cFor me, the biggest change was in the demography, not in the buildings themselves. Today, Valletta is alive and buzzing, but nobody seems to actually live in the city,\u201d he claims.\nMr Pisani\u2019s love affair with the city is a long-standing one. He started taking photos in Valletta in 1982, aged 17. At the time, he had no idea that the project would grow into an extended photo essay.\n\u201cI just loved being in Valletta and roaming through the streets. Despite the fact that Valletta wasn\u2019t looking its best, I found it very beautiful, even in the decay,\u201d he reminisces.\nIt was to be a lengthy documentation process, with the photographer spending a lot of time in the bars on what he calls \u201cthe lower, less reputable parts of Valletta\u201d.\nIt was this bond with the city that gave birth to what, at first, was an unstructured journey, the only wish of the photographer being to record what he was living at the time.\nIn time, the journey developed its own path towards documentation in an organic manner, and Mr Pisani found his natural inclination taking him to particular areas within the city.\n\u201cThe works focus particularly on the socially deprived areas. Yes, they were socially difficult areas but they were alive,\u201d he tells me.\nThe culture clash between the old community and the newer one is even more evident now\nThis was at a time when the drive towards regeneration had not yet started, and theatre-goers would have been very hard pressed to find somewhere to have a bite once the clock hit 9.30pm.\nIt was also a time when outsiders would claim that the capital city was empty after dark, a claim that anyone with inside knowledge of the local community is fast to rebut.\nAs a teenager growing up in Valletta, I would certainly have been greeted by very confused looks had I tried to hunt for an Aperol Spritz \u2013 today ubiquitously advertised outside every single bar and restaurant.\nBut the local communities that congregated in the tiny corner shops, selling cheap shots of whisky and fortified glasses of tea, were there if you knew where to look for them.\nOld Bakery Street, June 2007\nThis is also Mr Pisani\u2019s experience of the city: \u201cPeople who claimed that Valletta was dead at night never ventured further down than Pjazza Re\u0121ina. It was very alive, even if not in the best of ways. If ever there was an identity, it was with the Beltin,\u201d he says.\nMost of the locations photographed by Mr Pisani do not exist anymore, or have been renovated beyond recognition.\nMeantime, the result of his photographic documentation is currently showing at Spazju Kreattiv under the title Vanishing Valletta. Part of the collection was originally shown in Paris back in 1996; the feedback it garnered inspired him to take a more systematic approach in order to grow the collection.\nSince then, Vanishing Valletta has been shown in several art institutions overseas, while in France it forms part of the permanent collections of the Bibliotheque Nationale de France.\n\u201cI wanted to show this collection in Malta because I felt that Valletta deserved to see it.\u00a0 However, so far there is no museum or art institution in Malta that owns a part of this collection,\u201d he adds.\nSmall consolation though it is, the Beltin can take comfort in the knowledge that the soul of their disappearing city lives on in a museum in France.", "comment_count": 31, "id": 3307}, {"keywords": "", "author": "Sarah Carabott", "article_body": "\u201cI am not, and I don\u2019t want to become, another Dun \u0120or\u0121 Grima.\u201d\n\u00a0That\u2019s one thing Fr Alex Cauchi makes amply clear early in our interview.\n\u201cHe was one \u2013 the founder of the movement.

His mission here is to make sure the movement\u2019s wheel continues to turn, after slowing down slightly following Fr Grima\u2019s demise.\nAmong its major projects, \u0120esu fil-Proxxmu (Jesus in Thy Neighbour) feeds 23,000 children taking part in education programmes in Brazil, Kenya and Ethiopia, and has built several dwellings, schools and hospitals, its latest being a centre for children with disabilities in Ethiopia.\nGozo-born and raised, Fr Grima embarked on his missionary work in 1977 in Brazil, founding the movement a decade later. He passed away in September 2017 after undergoing heart bypass surgery.\nSince then, donations have declined while expenses are ever on the rise.\nFr Cauchi observed that the most loyal benefactors had kept up their donations but others seemed to be getting cold feet and some thought the movement had died with the passing of Fr Grima.\nAs things stand, the movement\u2019s outlay is higher than its revenues. Its feeding programme alone costs \u20ac80,000 a month.\nAll beginnings are difficult, and I\u2019m taking it day by day\nFr Cauchi said a request for assistance was made to him by Fr Grima in July of 2017, only a couple of months before he passed away. The younger priest had promised to return the following summer and spend a year with Fr Grima to learn the ropes and understand whether he could take on the role.\nBut that decision was made for him. That September, he was asked by Bishop Mario Grech to assume the directorship of the movement.\nHe has since visited the movement\u2019s projects in Africa and believes there is huge potential to turn things around in Kenya and Ethiopia, where the situation is similar to that of northeast Brazil 50 years ago. In Africa, he says, people are willing to work and the tourism industry, among others, is picking up, creating new jobs.\nInspired by the work of the Church in Brazil, where the poor are empowered rather than simply assisted, he hopes that small initiatives in the African countries will kick off sustainable projects.\n\u00a0\u201cWe plan to provide residents with brick moulds and cement, so that they can produce bricks for the movement\u2019s own projects, rather than resorting to buying them off a producer from a faraway city,\u201d he explained.\n\u201cThis way, the residents can learn a skill and start their own business, becoming self-sustainable.\u201d\nWhen it comes to donations of animals like cows and sheep, the movement would be tying the beneficiaries to providing the diocese with a calf or a lamb, which would then be gifted to another family in need.\nBy empowering people to become self-sustainable, they would in turn become less dependent on the movement, and the organisation could then move on and focus on other areas in need, he says.\n\u201cAll beginnings are difficult, and I\u2019m taking it day by day, believing, as Dun \u0120or\u0121 did, in providence.\u201d\nStill, he is well aware of the fundraising difficulties faced by smaller charities like the movement.\nHe has started networking with Maltese migrant benefactors in Australia, Gibraltar, and the movement has opened two charity shops on Triq l-Ewropa and Pjazza Savina in Victoria \u2013 a concept that has gone down well with residents and visitors.\nVisit\u00a0www.gesufilproxxmu.com\u00a0or call on 2155 6453 for more information about how to help out the organisation.

The editorial questions whether the commercial flavour of most events is diluting the traditional authenticity of Christmas on the island. This is balanced by an article on Schola Cantorum Jubilate, featured in the cover, and its popular annual Christmas event at the Priory of St Augustine in Victoria, an event which remarkably combines spirituality, culture and gastronomy. We can read more about the experiences of selfless youths who travel to far-off places like Cambodia, Per\u00f9, Guatemala and Kenya on missionary projects. The old photo of the month recalls the opening of St Therese Hospital in 1929\u2026 and there\u2019s more - theatre, sport, history, biography and satire.\nilhajjafghawdex@gozodiocese.org", "comment_count": 0, "id": 3316}, {"keywords": "Gozo", "author": "", "article_body": "Gozo Bishop Mario Grech\u00a0welcomed members of the clergy and representatives of various lay organisations at the Gozo Curia for New Year\u2019s greetings last Sunday.

The study was a dissertation project that Gatt conducted as part of the Master in Counselling degree at the University of Malta.\nEtienne Gatt\nThe six participants in the study coming from local families whose parents have less than five \u2018O\u2019 levels. Despite coming from backgrounds characterised by hardship the study found that this in actually helped them to become mature, dependable and hardworking individuals. The participants recognised how these positive characteristics have been invaluable in helping them to be successful in life. It was interesting to discover that such experiences are consistent with research conducted internationally.\nDespite the participants coming from different age brackets, they had encountered similar difficulties. They were faced with feelings of inferiority, inadequacy, loneliness and hardship.\nThey also reported how such experiences forged them with an identity that has distanced them from the identities of their families of origin. When seen from a Maltese perspective, this disclosure assumes more importance given the tight-knit characteristics of local families.\nGatt said the study\u2019s main findings show the importance of counselling as a service to assist individuals in drawing meaning out of such experiences.\n\u201cThe role of counselling and the counsellor is that of providing a safe space where feelings, such as those of loneliness and inadequacy, can be safely discussed and made meaning of. This is especially the case where individuals have lesser access to networks of role models that can assist and positively influence their trajectories,\u201d Gatt said.\n\u201cIt also needs to be considered that, usually, individuals going through such experiences are of a younger age and certain families might not afford such services. Therefore, accessible counselling can significantly help individuals navigate such experiences and may contribute in ensuring more equitable forms of social justice,\u201d he added.\nA copy of this study may be found at the University of Malta library. Gatt undertook the Master in Counselling with the support of a scholarship funded by the Endeavour Scholarship Scheme.", "comment_count": 0, "id": 3318}]
