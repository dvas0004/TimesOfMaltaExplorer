Interview by Ramona Depares.\nOn Monday, it will be three months to the day since you were appointed mayor of Valletta following Alexiei Dingli\u2019s resignation. What were your priorities then, and how has being in the hot seat helped them evolve?\nWhen you\u2019re a councillor, deputy mayor, or even just a candidate, you have full faith that you\u2019ll manage to turn the entire system on its head. Enthusiasm is in overdrive and you believe you can solve all problems. Then you get appointed and you\u2019re faced with practical realities; you realise that you need to be very creative in order to reach maximum efficiency.\nHaving served as deputy mayor prior to taking on this responsibility, I was lucky as I already had a good pulse on the most urgent issues. I hit the ground running.\nI\u2019ve learnt quite a few things in these past few months, one of the most important lessons possibly being that when the budget from central government is not enough for all the projects that I planned, it does not mean I give up. It simply means that I have to think out of the box.\nWhat does \u2018thinking out of the box\u2019 entail?\nI create initiatives to generate money for the locality. I am a firm believer in working with the private sector without, of course, compromising one\u2019s political position.\nNowadays, most serious companies have a functional Corporate Social Responsibility programme and are happy to take on board worthwhile initiatives that benefit a community.\nI\u2019ll give you one example \u2013 not too long ago the council managed to introduce a system whereby elderly Valletta residents are offered free transport around the city itself and to certain landmark destinations such as the Floriana polyclinic and Mater Dei. (See sidebar)\nThe initiative came from the council, it is not something that government had allocated any funding for. Had we waited until official funding came along, the whole thing would never have gotten off the ground. Instead, we held talks with a private company, who have offered us two vehicles as part of their CSR programme.\nThis is the way to get finances, by creating initiatives for the good of the locality itself and the residents and roping in the private sector.\nI don\u2019t believe in being a passive mayor. If there isn\u2019t any money for something that will be of benefit to the residents, then I try to find it. This is what I mean by thinking outside the box.\nWhat has been your plan of action since your appointment?\nI was appointed at a strange time, about four months before local council elections take place. Because of this, it would be presumptions of me to initiate a list of new projects immediately. Being an efficient mayor also involves keeping your feet on the ground. At this stage, I took stock of what my predecessor was doing and developed on that, at least until the elections are over.\nMy first priority remains the residents\u2019 well-being, and that is where I am devoting my efforts at the moment, particularly with respect to some areas where a number of residents may have been feeling that the council was out of touch. I don\u2019t want to bring the residents closer to the council, but vice-versa. It is the council that needs to reach out to the residents.\nOne topic that has become a bone of contention with residents is the re-opening of the old market on Merchant\u2019s Street. Many feel that the landmark building \u2013 which was considered quite a focal point within the community before it closed down \u2013 has been transformed into a purely commercial entity that does not cater for the homegrown community. What are your thoughts about this?\nThis question brings me back to the topic of CSR. Yes, I am aware that a portion of residents were not happy with the way the building is being repurposed. However, the council recently held a very productive meeting, and a series of events that have the community at heart are being organised.\nThe council needs to regain control of the warden system\nWe\u2019ve already held a very popular event where primary schoolchildren spent a morning preparing figolli with the staff from the market, and the response was very encouraging. It was very hands-on, and there was much laughter involved, as you can imagine.\nThere are plans for other events, including some that will focus on the elderly residents. It is important to include\u00a0 the community even in the commercial aspect, and CSR helps a lot with this.\nAnother bone of contention is the wardens system, which now no longer falls within the remit of the councils but is operated and controlled by LESA. Residents complain that the new system is more focused on generating revenue through fines than on ensuring residents\u2019 wellbeing. What is your position as mayor?\nNo-one knows the problems of a locality better than the council of that locality. Before the system was privatised, we\u2019d be aware of specific hotspots and we would set stronger surveillance and, if necessary take action.\nToday, fines are issued but this does not benefit residents at all. For starters, the revenue from these fines now goes to LESA, not to the council. When you impose a hefty fine on a resident, you cannot even put it in a fund that will be used to benefit the locality, including that same resident.\nThe council needs to regain control of the system. I\u2019ll give you an example to explain why the current one doesn\u2019t work: let\u2019s say that the warden shows up and finds a resident\u2019s car parked on yellow lines, but not blocking anyone. The resident is fined. However, the car in the green box that is reserved for residents remains parked with impunity and no fine is imposed.\nIt is easy to see where the injustice lies. Both are in the wrong, of course. But the warden fails to consider that the resident may have returned from a long day at work, late in the evening, to find all the residents\u2019 parking spots taken up by non-residents. The local council is in touch with the situation that residents face on a daily basis and is more in a position to enforce justice. As things stand, sometimes I fear that there is a lack of common sense.\nTo add insult to injury, not only does the driver that took a resident\u2019s parking spot escape being fined, but the income gathered from the fine that was imposed on the resident will not even be used to the benefit of the city.\nI am not happy with the current wardens system. In Valletta, it is inefficient. They are not all inefficient, but they are certainly not offering anything to the residents.\nA related topic is that of waste management. It is no secret that on a typical morning, a number of street corners in Valletta could be easily mistaken for dumping sites, with small mountains of garbage bags that would have been taken out by business outlets late at night. What are your thoughts?\nIt is unacceptable. Again, responsibility for this was taken away from the council. This is not to say that when complaints are made I turn my face the other way simply because I am not the responsible entity. This is not the way I do things. I divert the complaint through the correct channels to the department responsible, and I do try to follow up and keep an eye on the situation.\nAccording to the last census held by the National Statistic Offices, in 2011 the population in Valletta stood at just over 5,000. It has been on a steady decline over the past three decades. Yet, property prices keep increasing. What is happening?\nThe demographics in Valletta have changed. The original families are slowly getting depleted, with more foreigners and people who are not originally from the city moving in. This does not mean that the community itself is dying \u2013 what makes you part of the community is your attachment to it, not your birthplace. A foreigner who is involved within community life can be as much of a Belti as someone who was born here.\nHaving said that, I much fear that the new influx of residents includes a lot of people who only live in the city for a short while. For example, wealthy foreigners buy palazzi, restore them, and only use them while on their annual vacation in Valletta.\nThe same issue applies to a lot of those who rent, or even buy \u2013 their residence in the capital tends to be transient, and they can\u2019t be really considered part of the Valletta community. This does not apply to everyone, of course, but there is a definite trend.\nProperty prices in Valletta have gone through the roof, which is quoted as one of the reasons why the community is being depleted. Are such high prices sustainable in the long term or is there a chance the market will implode?\nI am not a property speculator, so I am not the right person to answer this question. But I will say this. I do hope that we don\u2019t find ourselves in a situation where we have to regress, rather than progress.\nValletta\u2019s tenure as European Capital of Culture came to an end in December. What is its legacy?\nYou can\u2019t really say, not so soon after the tenure ended. You tend to see the effects of a legacy years down the line. The more immediate effects were tied to a boom in investment, especially in boutique hotels and restaurants. There have also been a number of infrastructural improvements, from the Renzo Piano Parliament building, to St George\u2019s Square, Pjazza de Valette, St Elmo... these are all improvements that came about as a result of Valletta 2018.\nThe Valletta Cultural Agency was recently launched as what has been termed a \u2018legacy\u2019 to the Valletta 2018 Foundation. How strong is the council\u2019s presence within this Agency?\nThe only facts the council knows about the Valletta Cultural Agency is what we read in the media. No meetings have been set. As a council, we have not been acquainted with its functions or workings, so I cannot speak about it.\nAnd are you happy with this?\nRight now our priorities are to lead the council to elections, but once those are done, the Valletta Cultural Agency is one of the issues the council will be addressing.\nCan the commercial side of Valletta co-exist with its residents?\nI believe in balance. Valletta lay forgotten for years until, back in 2011, former Prime Minister Lawrence Gonzi initiated a drive towards its regeneration. His vision worked and, nowadays, the capital is alive, even in the evenings.\nBut have we gone to the other extreme, from no commercial life to the exact opposite?\nI believe in balance, in every area of life. This includes a balance between the residential and the commercial aspects of the capital. I also believe that when all stakeholders get together around a table and communicate, a lot of issues are resolved.\nWhat about claims that the commercial and entertainment aspect of a European capital take priority over residents?\nI disagree with these claims, categorically. As I said earlier, a balance between the two must be found. When I did not form part of the council, I was one of those who believed that we did not need a commercial presence in Valletta. Today, I see that I was being short-sighted.\nHowever, this does not mean that businesses will be allowed to ride roughshod over residents.\u00a0 Also, let us remember that many businesses do provide employment for Valletta residents.\nParking remains a major problem for residents, with the green boxes either not being respected or simply not being enough. Are there plans to address this?\nThe council has come up with several initiatives to mitigate the issue. One such initiative involved transforming the area around what we call the Yellow Garage into a fully-functional carpark. The project was accepted by central government and there were several expressions of interest.\nThe council picked the offer made by Valletta FC, as it included a strong social element that offered benefits even to the residents. Parking would be offered to residents and the immediate family of residents at subsidised rates, and a shuttle service offered. This would be of great help for those who visit their elderly parents. There was even a plan to offer these people free parking over the weekend, which is when many events are held in the capital. This way, at worst a resident can use the carpark and take the shuttle home.\nI don\u2019t believe in being a passive mayor\nWhen will this project be launched?\nWe don\u2019t know as progress has stalled on the side of central government. After the best offer had already been picked, numerous enquiries made by the council were met with the reply that the government is evaluating some other proposals.\nWhat do you hope will be your legacy as mayor?\nI hope to be remembered as a mayor who fostered unity. I am not the mayor for the Nationalist voters or the mayor for the Labourites. I\u2019m the mayor for all Valletta residents and my commitment is to all of them.\nTo this end, the council has launched a number of initiatives aimed at bringing Valletta residents together. We just had a comprehensive list of events to celebrate Valletta Day in March \u2013 to give you one example, all elderly residents were taken out for dinner to celebrate. We are opening a day centre for elderly people shortly; the idea is to not only bring together the people of Valletta, but also to offer a hang-out space for those who may be lonely.\nI follow this philosophy of inclusion and unity with every aspect, even the offices of the council themselves, which are open to everyone. We plan to open a hub where those who belong to a Valletta association, whether related to sport, feasts or whatever, can hang out and showcase memorabilia. Another project is the opening of a centre from where Valletta residents can tend to certain health or civic related matters.\nFree transport scheme for elderly to be extended\nA pilot scheme that offers elderly Valletta residents free transport within and around the city, as well as to the Floriana Health Centre and Mater Dei, is now being extended to operate on Saturdays and Sundays.\nThe scheme offers a doorstep pick-up service via a phone booking system.\n\u201cThe percentage of elderly residents in Valletta is high and, unfortunately, so is the percentage of steep hills. One of the recurring laments that the local council faces is that it can be quite difficult for an elderly person to get around the city to carry out the simplest of chores,\u201d mayor Christian Micallef said.\nThe vehicles, which are provided by Continental Cars, not only stop at the main landmarks in Valletta but will take the elderly resident to any part of the city they wish. So far, it is mostly being requested for hospital and health centre appointments.\nThe population in Valletta tends to be concentrated around the peripheries of the city, which makes reaching the bus terminus a problem for many due to the steep hills involved.\nAn elderly person living near the Mediterranean Conference Centre, for example, needs at least 20 minutes to walk to the terminus. Besides the uphill they face exposure to the elements.\nThe initiative has been so well-received that Mr Micallef plans to encourage its use not only for what are viewed as \u2018essential\u2019 outings but also for leisure purposes.\n\u201cIt is a reality that many elderly Valletta residents end up trapped in their homes due to lack of mobility. Our aim is to put a stop to this situation where many people end up feeling \u2018cut off\u2019 from life, sometimes spending days on end alone. If we have a situation where an elderly person books transport and is dropped off in the centre for a coffee and a stroll, and then is picked up again at a pre-arranged time, then I consider this a good thing.\u201d", "comment_count": 0, "id": 1541}, {"keywords": "", "author": "", "article_body": "Updated Monday 9am with victim details\nTwo \u017babbar women died and seven were injured in a horrific traffic accident close to the roundabout which leads to M\u0121arr on Sunday night.The two victims.\nTwo cars collided in the area known as Il-Buqana at about 9pm, with one of the vehicles ending up in a ditch and another on a centre strip.\nThe crash involved a Red Audi A1 and a blue Maruti 800.

He appears genuinely perplexed that he has had to face so much criticism in the nine years since he took over the shipyard, from complaints about noise and dirt to salacious gossip about the court case.\nHe was anxious to tackle this \u2018elephant in the room\u2019 first, stressing that he remained convinced that he would be vindicated by the outcome of the two appeals, which should be heard within the coming months.\nWhat happened in Messina is very simple: it was a vendetta against me for exposing wrongful practices\n\u201cLook around at what I do here. Look at the values and philosophy of the company with regards to the environment and occupational health and safety of the workers.\n\u201cWhat happened in Messina is very simple: it was a vendetta against me for exposing wrongful practices. And I and my family have paid dearly for my stand,\u201d he insisted.\n\u2018Best yard in the Med\u2019\nThe court proceedings have not dimmed the momentum at the yards, where various investments were made with \u201cthe next phase\u201d in mind. He spent much of the early years bringing the yard up to date, literally clearing out years of neglect. Once that was done, he invested in a solar farm, aiming to expand it to get as much as 40 per cent of his energy from it within two or three years.\nHowever, the key to the yard\u2019s success will be how well it positions itself to offer something to differentiate itself from the rest. Mr Palumbo already describes it as the best yard in the Mediterranean \u2013 and in the world within two or three years \u2013 but he acknowledges that the most important factor is to offer something extra.\nPerhaps the best way to explain this innovative approach is the superyacht \u2018village\u2019. The former stores have been turned into a complete refuge for superyacht crews \u2013 who are often there for months at a time during the boat refits. There are now dozens of rooms available for rent, a spa and gym, meeting rooms for project teams, and a small restaurant, all built around original architectural features like beams and fireplace alcoves.\nThe superyacht facility at the shipyard also turned a profit.\n\u201cIf I want to attract more superyachts, then it is not enough to offer only technical facilities. All this expense will not make me more profits, but it will attract more business,\u201d he said.\nAt the time of the interview, the new \u20ac2.5 million 420-tonne travel lift was bringing a superyacht out of the water, with two more in the covered facility, two others alongside the quay, and a 90m superyacht under a temporary tent built to control the environment for a re-paint.\nThe shipyard has also identified various niches where there is not such fierce competition, such as the installation of scrubbers for ships\u2019 exhaust, refits of cruise ships and conversion of fuel systems from diesel to natural gas.\nOne disappointment is the oil and gas sector, which is still going through a difficult time thanks to geo-political upheavals.\n\u201cWe did not move away from the oil and gas sector; it moved away from us,\u201d he shrugged wistfully. \u201cWe do believe that it will eventually rebound \u2013 but it will look very different. We are planning to be ready when that happens.\u201d\n\u20ac1 million profit\nSo much for the infrastructure. What everyone wants to know is whether this black pit which soaked up so many millions of taxpayers\u2019 money for so many years is now economically viable.\nThe yard had a turnover of \u20ac41 million in 2017, up from \u20ac30 million a year earlier \u2013 but the cost of sales remains high at \u20ac38 million (2016: \u20ac26m), resulting in a profit before tax of just over \u20ac1 million, which he described as \u201cvery healthy\u201d.\n\u201cBut we are not satisfied. We will increase that,\u201d he added.\nThe superyacht side was also profitable, making \u20ac38,928 before tax on a turnover of \u20ac5.2 million (with a tax contribution which brought it up to \u20ac1.5 million).\nMr Palumbo argued that the return was fairly normal for the industry, given the cyclical nature of the work, and explaining that he also had to factor in the millions in annual concession fees paid to the government \u2013 and the high levels of investment that were still being made, \u20ac4 million last year alone.\nI would happily take on dozens of locals if they had the specialised skills that we need\nIt is company policy that no dividends are paid out, however the directors\u2019 remuneration in 2017 was \u20ac396,401 from the yard.\nWas that high, given the level of profits?\n\u201cIt is the \u2018prize\u2019 for nine years of hard work,\u201d he explained, saying that this amount varied across the years.\nApart from the investment in the operational side of the yards, his labour model is radically different \u2013 and sometimes very misunderstood by those who remember the yard when it employed thousands. The shipyard employed 61 people in 2017 \u2013 only 36 of whom were involved in operations. He relies on subcontractors for the rest and leaves them to get on with their own recruitment.\n\u201cThis is the market\u2019s standard model. You have to be very flexible in this globalised world and to abide by its rules. Criticism comes from those who do not understand \u2013 or want to face up to \u2013 the reality.\n\u201cIf we were to take on the employees ourselves, we would reach the point in this cyclical industry where there would not be enough work for them to do.\u201d\nHuman resources problem\nHowever, one aspect that is perhaps overlooked is that he would be happy to take on more full-time staff.\n\u201cI have placed adverts at least 20 times for staff and I have never received a single CV,\u201d he complained, adding that he had also hosted several visits from Mcast students without success.\n\u201cI would happily take on dozens of locals if they had the specialised skills that we need,\u201d he said wistfully. \u201cAnd if they were willing to get their hands dirty. It costs me considerably more to recruit a foreigner who needs accommodation and so on. Malta has a real problem with human resources.\u201d\nRooms are available for rent for crews and they include spa and gym facilities.\nA yardstick to judge by\n\u25aa The superyacht facility handled 52 yachts last year, bringing the total since he took over in 2011 to some 300.\n\u25aa The shipyard hosted 201 projects, including six cruise liners.\n\u25aa Apart from the boat lift, Palumbo also invested \u20ac250,000 in a trailer capable of transporting yachts up to 210 tonnes.\n\u25aa The shipyard ended up with \u20ac8.3 million in retained earnings in 2017, with the profits also transferred to reserves.", "comment_count": 10, "id": 1543}, {"keywords": "", "author": "", "article_body": "Two men came to blows and one of them ended up in hospital in a road-rage incident near the Skate Park in Tal-Qroqq on Sunday afternoon.\nThe police said the incident involved a Serbian man, 41 and another man from Lija, 31.

The incident was reportedly described by presiding Judge Michael Mallia as \u201cshameful\u201d and \u201cappalling\u201d.\u00a0\u00a0\nDr Lia has been under the media\u2019s glare since The Malta Independent on Sunday reported last November that she would be appointed magistrate.\nLast Wednesday the Times of Malta named her as one of three lawyers heading for judicial office, along with three sitting magistrates set to become judges. These appointments seem set to take place before the government implements promised changes to the judicial appointments system that has been roundly faulted by justice experts (see below).\nAsked to deny or confirm that she would be appointed magistrate, Dr Lia declined to comment. Questions sent to Justice Minister Owen Bonnici via e-mail seeking verification of her nomination also remained unanswered.\nThe media reports on Dr Lia have generated particular controversy because she is daughter-in-law of Pawlu Lia, personal lawyer of the Prime Minister and other Labour Party figures, as well as the Prime Minister\u2019s appointee on the Commission for the Administration of Justice.\nThe grumblings in the legal profession have been that these multiple roles constitute conflict of interest that would become more problematic if his daughter-in-law had to become magistrate.\u00a0\nNadine Lia declined to comment\nLast month The Malta Independent on Sunday reported of a \u201cnumber of lawyers\u201d who \u201ccould boycott\u201d causes assigned to Dr Lia if she became magistrate. They also claimed that they would take the matter to the constitutional court, a possibility that is not far-fetched in the aftermath of last December\u2019s Venice Commission\u2019s opinion on Malta.\nAt the time, justice expert and co-author of the Malta report, Martin Kuijer, had told Times of Malta\u00a0 that the European Court of Human Rights often cites Venice Commission opinion in its judgements. That could work against Malta in potential cases after the Venice Commission wrote that Malta\u2019s system of judicial appointments \u201cfalls short of ensuring judicial independence\u201d.\nConfirmation of the proceedings at the justice commission is likely to generate more controversy. Two retired judges, speaking on condition of anonymity, expressed different sentiments: one said judicial roles are so sensitive that appointees have to be \u201cas perfect as possible\u201d; the other said that the courtroom squabbles that triggered the proceedings had been \u201chyped up\u201d.\nBoth added that consideration has to be given to the sanction, something that remains unknown \u2013 the law imposes secrecy on \u201cfindings\u201d or \u201cdisciplinary penalties\u201d.\u00a0\nLouis de Gabriele, president of the Chamber of Advocates and member of the JAC (which evaluates candidates for the judiciary), said that the JAC \u201ccheck if there are ongoing proceedings or concluded proceedings about any candidate\u201d.\u00a0\nAlthough Dr de Gabriele would not be drawn into talking about specific examples, he said that in any \u201cbreach of the code of ethics\u201d the JAC would \u201clook into the merits of the proceedings, the gravity of misconduct, and the time elapsed since it occurred. The sanction in itself is indicative of how serious the breach was, and whether it should be an impediment to a positive assessment of a candidate for the judiciary\u201d.\nDr Nadine Lia declined to comment on any question put to her, including questions about the proceedings and whether the case should impede her from judicial appointment. Contacted on the phone, she maintained that she is \u201ca private person\u201d who \u201cdoes not comment to the media, on this subject or any other\u201d.\nUntil last week she was still engaged at the Family Business Office, where she is designated as the Regulator.

In the article Dr Lia speaks enthusiastically about her immersive role in the Family Business Office.\nInsipid assessment process for judicial appointments denounced by experts\nThe Judicial Appointments Committee (JAC), set up less than three years ago to evaluate interested candidates for the judiciary, has been roundly dismissed for being comprehensively flawed.\nThe JAC\u2019s criteria for evaluating candidates are based on 10 broad principles \u2013 including criterions such as good communication skills in English and Maltese, knowledge of law and court processes, professional legal experience and familiarity with the code of ethics for the judiciary.\nThe criteria is described as \u201cgood but rudimentary\u201d by Kevin Aquilina, dean of Faculty of Law at the University of Malta.\n\u201cIt\u2019s criteria that allow mediocrity instead of fostering excellence,\u201d he added.\u00a0\nThe JAC has apparently been modelled on the UK\u2019s Judicial Appointments Commission, set up 13 years ago to \u201cselect candidates for judicial office\u201d on \u201cmerit, through fair and open competition, from the widest range of eligible candidates\u201d. Rigorous evaluations are held after issuing calls for vacant posts.\u00a0\nBy contrast, Malta\u2019s JAC evaluates candidates who come forward and registers those positively assessed. The Prime Minister retains absolute discretion on judicial appointments and promotions (from magistrate to judge).\n\u201cThe JAC\u2019s selection procedure is bad because there is no healthy competition between candidates after expressions of interest are issued,\u201d Prof. Aquilina explained.\n\u201cIf a thousand lawyers apply for one vacant post and all satisfy the criteria, as they will probably do, the JAC will recommend to the Prime Minister all one thousand lawyers for judicial office. It will not distinguish between the candidates on merit, and the real choice will have to be made by the Prime Minister.\u201d\nAnother point of criticism is the JAC\u2019s composition.\nProf. Aquilina points out that, in contrast to other European countries, only one of the JAC\u2019s members hails from the judiciary. \u201cMoreover,\u201d he added, \u201cin case law of the European Court of Human Rights the Public Prosecutor \u2013 in our case the Attorney General \u2013 should not sit on judicial appointing or promoting boards.\u201d\nJudge Emeritus Giovanni Bonello concurred: \u201cIt would be preferable for the large majority of JAC members to be experts in the legal profession.\u201d\nThe Council of Europe\u2019s Venice Commission, Europe\u2019s highest constitutional body, said in its opinion on Malta that \u201cthe Prime Minister should not have the power to influence the appointment of [the judiciary]\u201d.\n\u201cThe principle of independence of the judiciary,\u201d the Venice Commission wrote, \u201crequires that the selection of judges and magistrates be made upon merit and any undue political influence should be excluded.\u201d\nThe PN and Chamber of Advocates are broadly in agreement with the Commission\u2019s findings and recommendations.\u00a0\nThe Chief Justice also said at the opening of the forensic year last October that he would like to see broader criteria in the JAC\u2019s assessment. Asked to elaborate on his ideas, as well as what threshold of misconduct ought to preclude a candidate from judicial office, he wrote in an e-mail that \u201cyou will be receiving a relative reply from the Office of the Minister of Justice\u201d. The spokesperson for the Justice Minister did not provide any replies.\nJustice Minister Owen Bonnici has publicly promised to implement the Venice Commission\u2019s recommendations at an unspecified point in the future, but has not ruled out additional judicial appointments until the selection mechanism is overhauled.\nThe report in The Times of Malta of six impending new judiciary appointments has now intensified the mutterings in the legal profession that the government seems set to continue using the flawed JAC as a pretence of legitimacy for additional appointees of its choice.\n\u201cWhen no competition takes place, it would be difficult to make choices on merit and the final decision would have to be left in the discretion of the Prime Minister,\u201d said Prof. Aquilina. \u201cIt\u2019s a system that\u2019s unfair to the Prime Minister as it places too much responsibility on his shoulders, as well as the selected candidate, as the perception is that the choice was made on the basis of political patronage and not merit.\n\u201cTo add insult to injury, members of the judiciary are also chosen from political party lines or sympathisers, giving the impression that the government is more interested in putting its red- or blue-eyed boys and girls within the judiciary than advocates who are competent for the post.\u201d", "comment_count": 39, "id": 1546}, {"keywords": "", "author": "", "article_body": "Updated 7.31pm\u00a0 \u00a0- \n\nAn unconscious man who was pulled from the sea off Sliema Exiles beach on Sunday afternoon has been identified as a 33-year-old Belgian.\nPassers-by administered CPR after the man was spotted on the surface of the sea and was pulled ashore.\nThey were then assisted by an ambulance crew who later rushed the man to hospital.\nThe man could not be identified initially and the police issued a photo and requested information.

March 9, on the other hand, became the month\u2019s warmest day when the mercury hit 21.8\u00b0C.\nAt 15.8\u00b0C, the mean sea temperature during March was also warmer than the climate norm for this time of year.\nWith an average wind-speed of 9.9 knots, March was also slightly windier than expected, with the highest wind gust for the month, blowing from a north-west by north and north-north-west direction, reaching 49 knots on March 12.", "comment_count": 0, "id": 1612}, {"keywords": "", "author": "Matthew Xuereb", "article_body": "Popular Italian entertainer Gianni Morandi said he was \u201cvery excited\u201d about his first live concert in Malta on Friday.\nMr Morandi told Times of Malta he was also thrilled about being in Malta, an island close to Italy with which it has \u201camazingly close ties\u201d.\n\u201cI am very excited to be here to perform alone for the first time after a previous show many years ago when I sang with others.

Nonetheless, the department did not budge on the matter, until it was warned that its policy ran counter to a civil court judgment given by Mr Justice Lawrence Mintoff in 2015.\nDetails on this case were published in a report on Thursday by the Ombudsman which outlines some of the complaints filed in 2018. A copy of this report was presented by Ombudsman Anthony Mifsud to the Speaker of the House of Representatives An\u0121lu Farrugia.\nIt transpired that during her pregnancy the woman was told that she needed to go to the United Kingdom for treatment, after being diagnosed with a condition which would necessitate an urgent operation immediately after giving birth.\nHowever, prior to departure, the parents were told by the Health Department they were not going to be reimbursed for the airfares, in line with an existing policy regulating cases of babies or children under 18 years. The reason was that at the moment of departure the baby had not yet been born.\nA right to a clarification\nAfter lodging a complaint with the Health Commissioner, the department agreed to pay the costs for the baby\u2019s return flight from the UK to Malta, but not of the parents.\nThe commissioner disagreed with the decision on the grounds that the patient was the unborn baby, and consequently the parents\u2019 airfares should have been covered as well. Eventually, the department accepted to reimburse the parents\u2019 inbound flights.\nNonetheless, the department kept insisting it would not reimburse the outbound flights on the grounds that \u201ca baby in utero is not recognised as a person at law\u201d.\nThe response prompted the commissioner to remark that such interpretation made no sense at all.\nIf an unborn baby is not considered a person, on what does the surgeon operate when the ministry sends pregnant women for treatment abroad, before delivering their baby in Malta, the Commissioner questioned.\nFurthermore, the Commissioner referred to a 2015 judgment in which Mr Justice Mintoff had ruled that an unborn baby had its rights and that once conceived he/she was not an object but a person.\nIt was only at this stage, the department accepted to cover the outbound flights as well.\nIn his remarks, Commissioner for Health Charles Messina described the Health Department\u2019s categorical statement on the unborn child as \u201cunacceptable\u201d.\nApart from opening the entire contested issue of whether the human foetus had a right to the protection of law, it compromised the ongoing debate on whether abortion should or should not be entertained at any stage, he said.\nThis statement goes well beyond what various strata of the political spectrum to date publicly have stated to be their stand on this matter, the commissioner remarked.\nHe added that citizens had the right to a clarification on the matter and to be informed whether such a statement was the government\u2019s official position.\nThe Commissioner also made some points on the 2015 judgment, saying it merited further study and debate as it correctly enunciated the existing legal position.\nMr Messina expressed his opinion that this judgment ran counter to the Health Department statement that the human foetus did not enjoy any rights.\nNo policy which favours abortion - health department\nHowever, in a statement on Thursday, the Health Department said it had intervened to save the life of a yet unborn child by facilitating, organising and, paying for treatment abroad.\n\"How saving a newborn\u2019s life can by any stretch of the imagination lead the Commissioner for Health to relate this episode to a discussion on abortion, which is the exact opposite of saving a life, escapes comprehensibility,\" it said.\nThe department insisted it did not have any policy which favoured abortion.\nCommissioner for Health welcomes statement\nThe Commissioner for Health in a reaction told Times of Malta that he welcomed\u00a0 the categorical statement by the Department for Health that it did not have any policy which favoured abortion.\u00a0\nPN: Time to strengthen the rights of babies in the womb\u00a0\nThe Nationalist Party said the report was a wake-up call that the rights of babies in the womb need to be strengthened.\u00a0\nShadow minister Claudio Grech said the country needed to launch a process to ensure that the rights of the unborn were recognised, protected and improved so that there would be no legal grey areas.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe very fact, as shown in this report, that the authorities were uncertain about whether an unborn baby was a person was a clear indication that the laws needed to be clarified.
