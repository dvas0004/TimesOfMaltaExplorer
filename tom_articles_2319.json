All needed to have the same pay for the same work, and all should have the same work opportunities.\nIt was for this reason that the government had launched a courageous initiative to bring about a stronger representation of women in national decision-making. It was unacceptable that just 27 women had been elected to parliament since elections were first held. It was indeed a pity that such a reform was not carried out earlier.\u00a0\nConcluding, Dr Muscat said Freedom Day - March 31, 1979 - was a milestone which was part of a series of other historical milestones including the granting of Independence and the declaration of the Republic and all these days should be a source of unity and pride for the people.\nFollowing his address Dr Muscat lit the freedom torch at the top of the monument.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0", "comment_count": 60, "id": 2521}, {"keywords": "", "author": "Keith Micallef", "article_body": "A call for expressions of interest for the lease of the former Raffles disco in St Andrew\u2019s for commercial use has been extended by two weeks, but the Labour Party which owns this prized asset is still seeking to choose the preferred proposal by July.\nIssued on February 11, the call was originally meant to close on March 29 but has now been extended to April 12.\nTimes of Malta sought an explanation for the extension and asked about the number of proposals, if any, which had been submitted to date.\nHowever, none of these questions were answered, with a party spokesman saying that they would be in a position to announce the number of submissions received after the closing date.

The policy lays down that only non-commercially viable programmes of a social, culture and educational nature can be partially or fully funded by taxpayers. However, a National Audit Office investigation in 2010 revealed this was not always the case.\nThe data provided by PBS shows that while prior to 2013, under a Nationalist administration, Xarabank, the national TV\u2019s most popular programme according to audience surveys, was afforded most public funds, subventions for the programme were cut drastically by the new administration.\nInversely, more public funds were channelled to other current affairs/discussion programmes, particularly those produced by MaltaToday managing editor Saviour Balzan.\nDuring the 2012/2013 TV schedule, more than \u20ac400,000 in public funds had been dedicated to Xarabank, the amount dropping to \u20ac54,000 by 2016/2017, the last schedule for which data is available.\nOn the other hand, Mr Balzan\u2019s Reporter, which had received \u20ac749 in public funds in the 2012/2013 schedule, was allocated a subvention amounting to \u20ac79,836, \u20ac168,890 and \u20ac83,262 in the following three years.\nMr Balzan started producing a new discussion programme \u2013 Xtra \u2013 as from the 2016/2017 schedule for which PBS allocated almost \u20ac78,000.\nAnother discussion programme that saw an increase in public funding was Brian Hansford\u2019s Realt\u00e0, while Reno Bugeja\u2019s Dissett retained a constant public funding of about \u20ac50,000.\nMr Balzan was also tasked with the production of two other TVM programmes, cooking show Gourmet and Dwarna, a socio-psychological discussion presented by his sister, Mariella.

This was happening on an island with limited space and even more limited resources, he warned.\nEven worse, the majority of these imported workers were in low-wage sectors.\nTotal output may be on the rise, but this did not mean quality of life was also improving.\nAsked if he would therefore try and restrict the number of foreign workers on the island, Dr Delia said he would instead come up with policies that did not depend solely on an influx of labour.\nThe policies he was for, would see risk spread across various economic sectors \u2013 business leaders know not to put all their eggs in one basket, he said.\nReputation damage\u00a0\nThe government might be planning a move into contentious areas like cryptocurrency, but this would be much more difficult if the country did not have a solid reputation, Dr Delia went on to argue.\nReplying to questions put by\u00a0EMCS Malta's Stefano Mallia, Dr Delia said he had\u00a0lost count of the number of damning reports to slam the island\u2019s rule of law, democratic structures, and enforcement.\nMalta\u2019s international reputation, he lamented, was shattered.\nGRECO, the International Monetary Fund, and most recently MoneyVal\u2019s preliminary assessment of the island had come back with very worrying results he said.\nThe island now had three months to try and improve this poor showing in the MoneyVal report-\u201chardly enough time to turn things around\u201d, he said.\n\u201cSo yes, let\u2019s consider a move into innovative technologies and sectors, even if they may require some risks, but let\u2019s ensure we have a rock solid reputation to be able to take this challenge on,\u201d he said.\nTo this aim, the government should immediately implement the recommendations of the Council of Europe\u2019s Venice Commission.\nMalta a tax haven?\nReacting to a European Parliament vote in favour of a resolution labelling Malta as having the characteristics of a tax haven,\u00a0Dr Delia said it was not the first time other European member states had put pressure on the island to change its tax regime.\nHowever, when Malta had faced these challenges\u00a0in the past, it had the benefit of a good reputation to hold up as a defence.\nDr Delia said he would not go around Europe tarnishing Malta or undermining the jurisdiction, but something needed to be done to fix the island\u2019s reputation.\n\u201cAs an Opposition we will not defend the government but we will defend our country, and Maltese businesses. What is wrong is wrong. We can\u2019t live in denial, we need to get our head out of the sand,\u201d he said.\nBloated government and the construction boom\nLater during the conference, Dr Delia was asked for his views on the bloating of government with excessive public sector employment.\nHe said he would not go around firing people on the public payroll, but he would devise policies that saw workers only employed where necessary.\n\u201cIn one year the Water Services Corporation employed 100 plasters \u2013 we really needed them,\u201d he quipped.\nAsked what about his views on the construction boom, Dr Delia said the PN was in no way dependant on the construction lobby. Its revenue streams were diverse and the party would not bend to the will of any large interests, he said.\nAsked what sort of policies the PN favoured in this sector, Dr Delia said one could not plan to have no development, but could plan for sustainable development.\nHe concluded by saying that the government might be planning to make Malta metropolitan, but what did that really mean?

three libel suits filed against the Labour Party media.\nA total of five suits had originally been instituted against it-Tor\u010ba, l-Orizzont as well as the PL TV station over a series of publications alleging that Dr Busuttil had attempted to obtain \u201cdamning evidence\u201d from the Gaffarena family to use against former PN Minister John Dalli.The allegations said Dr Busuttil had met Joseph and his son Marco Gaffarena before the 2013 general election at the PN headquarters and demanded Daewoo papers in return for the granting of a petrol station permit, which the Gaffarena family had long been struggling to obtain.\nThe story first made its appearance on it-Tor\u010ba on August 2, 2015 with later related articles published on l-Orizzont and PL One News and One TV, alleging that Dr Busuttil, then PN Vice President, had allegedly attempted to bribe them in a bid to get at Mr Dalli.Josef Caruana, then editor of l-Orizzont, had allegedly based his story on information supplied by an anonymous source which was subsequently confirmed by Joseph Gaffarena when contacted by the paper.\nThe said meeting had allegedly been set up by former PN Minister Joseph Cassar who, when testifying in the course of the ensuing libel proceedings, had totally contradicted the version supplied by the Gaffarenas, his testimony being defined as \u201cconsistent\u201d by the Magistrates\u2019 Court.\nFollowing the five judgments, awarding a total of \u20ac7,000 in libel damages in favour of Dr Busuttil, three of those were appealed by Mr Josef Caruana, as former editor of l-Orizzont.\nWhen handing down judgment, the court of appeal, presided over by Mr Justice Anthony Ellul, concluded that Joseph Gaffarena\u2019s version, fed to the PL media, had been nothing but \u201ca complete setup\u201d which l-Orizzont and it-Tor\u010ba had taken up as the \u201cabsolute truth,\u201d without bothering to undertake any serious investigation to confirm the truth behind the allegations.\n\u201cIt was evident that there had been nothing except for a brief phone call by [Mr Caruana] to Gaffarena,\u201d the court observed, adding that the former journalist and editor could not shy away from responsibility for the articles penned.\nNo evidence had been put forward to prove that the PL media had any some way attempted to contact Dr Cassar to confirm the allegations before publishing the story, the court said.\nNor was there evidence of any written questions sent by the newspaper to Dr Busuttil before the story went public, the court went on, declaring that it had no doubt that the articles at issue had intended to convey a clear message, namely that Dr Busuttil had met Mr Gaffarena, had requested documents needed as \u201cdamning evidence\u201d against Mr Dalli and this in exchange for the petrol station permit.\nSuch a message, directly targeting the then Opposition Leader and thus a \u201cvery high profile political figure\u201d were \u201cin the public interest\u201d and had been evidently taken up by a wide readership base.\nYet on the basis of all evidence put forward, the court found no reasons to depart from the conclusions reached by the Magistrates\u2019 Court, declaring Joseph Gaffarena\u2019s version as lacking in credibility and remarking upon his \u201cnegative and arrogant\u201d stance at the witness stand, which defeated his own version of events.\n\u201cI\u2019ll die for [Labour],\u201d the witness had declared, casting doubt upon the credibility of his story and even admitting under cross-examination that he had been \u201cangry\u201d when allegedly meeting Dr Busuttil.\nIn fact, it was evident that Mr Gaffarena harboured a \u201cgrudge\u201d against Dr Busuttil who, at the time, had been directing harsh criticism against the PL, regularly mentioning the Gaffarena family over their Qormi petrol station permit and their involvement in the Old Mint Street property saga, the court observed.\nThe Gaffarena story had been pounced upon by the Labour Party media to strike back at Dr Busuttil, without however bothering to undertake any \u201cserious fact checking exercise\u201d and instead totally endorsing the Gaffarenas\u2019 version.\nA person like Mr Caruana, with great experience in journalism, \u201cought to have proceeded with much greater caution,\u201d the court observed, noting that the journalist and editor had failed to adopt \u201ca professional and diligent approach\u201d to check out the truth of the source.\nA phone call merely lasting minutes could never replace \u201cprofessional and diligent research,\u201d the court said, pointing out that the journalist ought to have smelt a rat \u201cfrom the outset,\u201d but had even failed to bother to confirm the story with Joseph Gaffarena\u2019s own son, Marco, who had allegedly accompanied his father to the PN Headquarters.\nThe court dismissed the three appeals, confirming the \u20ac5,000 damages award in favour of Dr Busuttil, noting that \u201ca good reputation was essential in political life as well as for one\u2019s own personal dignity,\u201d concluding that libel proceedings were intended to vindicate a

Chicken was considered suitable food for him, provided that it was properly mashed and that the patient was supervised as he ate.\nFollowing the patient's death, new rules for what constituted 'soft food' were introduced.\nA note stuck to the patient\u2019s bed read \u201cPosition for Feeding: seated/propped up\u201d and \u201cSupervise during feeding.\nHis wife neverthless told the court how she would often find her husband eating alone, without supervision.\nNurse Sant was responsible for the patient, with Ms Bonnici as his aide. The two had six patients in their care, with nurse Bondin in charge of the ward.\nAt the time of the incident, Ms Bonnici had been feeding another patient in another room.\nMagistrate Frendo Dimech began hearing the case in 2018, with it having been handed to her from a different magistrate.\u00a0\nStatements the accused had given to the police were discarded as there was no lawyer present during interrogation.\nSimilarly, the court discarded a report drawn up by the Mater Dei Hospital legal office about the internal inquiry, which had been presented but not confirmed on oath and therefore had no probatory value.\nThe court found that Ms Bonnici had fallen short of the standard of diligence expected of her. It found that Mr Sant was also negligent and had admitted that he had not checked whether the patient had actually eaten.\nHis failure to supervise led to the death of a patient entrusted to his care, the magistrate ruled.\nHe knew that the patient liked to eat, that he was at risk of choking and that his dementia made him prone to wandering, the court said. All this meant there was a greater duty to supervise him when there was food around, it added.\nThe court however noted that there were attenuating factors at play at the time. Mr Sant was looking after a trainee nurse, while Ms Bonnici was feeding a patient who was far more vulnerable than the victim.\nThey also reported to work earlier than they had to, which was a testament to their dedication, the court said.\nChief nurse Bondin, on the other hand, had done nothing wrong, the court said.\n\u201cOn the contrary, in the very unfortunate circumstances of this case, Maria Bondin did everything she could to ensure that the patient is given the best care. Her efforts to save his life were also noted,\u201d the magistrate said.\nThe court found Mr Sant and Ms Bonnici guilty of involuntary homicide, but said that their negligence did not merit effective prison time.\nNeither could be considered a threat to society, the magistrate said, and society would not benefit from their imprisonment.\nBoth had clean criminal records and their negligence was not due to not caring, she added.\nThe court noted that it was not requested to liquidate damages.\nIt cleared Maria Bondin of all guilt, and fined Mr Sant and Ms Bonnici, who were also ordered to pay the \u20ac1,644 due to court experts in the case.\nSuperintendent Dr Jeffrey Azzopardi prosecuted and Dr Stefano Filletti represented the patient's family.\nLawyers Stephen Tonna Lowell and Kris Scicluna represented Mr Sant and Ms Bonnici.

Previously people had to climb a long flight of stairs to reach the main door.\nMost of the books previously held at the Jesuits\u2019 library have been donated to the MUSEUM library in Blata l-Bajda, while some went to the Jesuits\u2019 Mount St Joseph retreat house in Mosta.\nThe project\u2019s realisation is a long-held dream come true for the local Jesuit community. Provincial delegate Fr Michael Bugeja SJ pointed out that Fr Gianfranco Matarazzo SJ, provincial of the new Euro-Mediterranean Province of which Malta forms part, gave the project the green light soon after the new province was created two years ago.\nThe project, he added, was perfectly in line with one of the Jesuit Order\u2019s four recently adopted \u2018Universal Apostolic Preferences\u2019 for the forthcoming decade \u2013 that of \u2018Journeying with youth\u2019.\nIt is hoped the Youth Hub will act as a magnet, attracting more than just casual drop-ins, but that individual students, youth groups, communities and lecturers will be encouraged to use to full capacity the building\u2019s various other facilities.\nThe small rooms and a large hall on the ground floor offer versatile space for individual or group study, collaboration, conversation, presentations, discussion or simply a comfortable place to hold meetings and seminars, or meet and greet guests. Such meeting places are sometimes lacking on campus.\nThe support the place can offer will complement the academic work of students on campus, which inevitably creates periods of stress\nThe ground floor also hosts a large kitchen and dining area, and a prayer room, while a small number of bedrooms on the first floor are available for short stays.\nUltimately, the Jesuits\u2019 hope is that at the Youth Hub, students and staff will find a welcoming space that provides them with practical support in their daily concerns, while the Jesuits will have additional opportunities to befriend them and engage at a deeper level of human and spiritual formation. A member of University Chaplaincy staff, student volunteers or a Jesuit community member will always be present to welcome visitors.\nUniversity chaplain Fr Patrick Magro, who also lives at the residence, said: \u201cWe occasionally have groups of students who ask to spend a few days with us during their study periods, during live-ins in preparation for voluntary work experiences and in the run-up to Easter.\u201d This weekend a visiting group of Spanish students from a Jesuit university college was being hosted at the residence.\nThe project\u2019s next phase involves installing a lift to the first floor and \u2018doing up\u2019 the central building\u2019s courtyard to include seating.\nIn the near future, the fields at the back of the Jesuit residence are expected to be deve\u00adloped to include a new University residence for foreign students and visiting academic staff, as well as new buildings hosting the faculties of education and social wellbeing. So rather than being at the periphery of the campus, the Youth Hub will find itself more at the centre of life on campus.\nUniversity Rector Prof. Alfred Vella, who was present for the inauguration, recalled that this year marked the 250th anniversary since the University was formally set up in 1769 after the Jesuits were expelled from Malta by Grand Master Manuel Pinto. The University took over the Collegium Melitense, which the Jesuits had founded in Valletta in 1592. But relations between the University and the Jesuits have long since improved, and there is a long tradition of Jesuits being appointed as University chaplains.\nThe project enjoys the University\u2019s full support, and following meetings between Prof. Vella and Fr Magro, the University is studying ways of offering practical support to the pro\u00adject through the provision of staff and services.\nProf. Vella remarked that the Youth Hub\u2019s location right next door to the University was very appropriate as the support the place could offer would complement the academic work the students undertook on the campus, which inevitably created periods of stress. \u201cEven University staff will find the place very useful,\u201d the rector joked, \u201cand slowly, slowly we may take over this place too\u201d.\nAuxiliary Bishop Mgr Joseph Galea Curmi, who blessed the Youth Hub, thanked the Jesuit province for the project, adding that it was also in line with Pope Francis\u2019s call for the promotion of a \u201cculture of encounter\u201d.", "comment_count": 1, "id": 2617}, {"keywords": "", "author": "Ivan Camilleri", "article_body": "Finance Minister Edward Scicluna is under pressure to sign a permit that would allow a member of Dubai\u2019s ruling family to buy the project to build hundreds of apartments on the site of the former Mistra Village tourist complex in Xemxija, The Sunday Times of Malta can reveal.\nThe Dubai sheik, whose name is not being divulged for data protection reasons, is asking the Office of the Prime Minister to be issued with a special AIP (Acquisition of Immovable Property) permit, which would enable him to purchase the entire project from Gemxija Crown Holdings, the Maltese company which owns the development.\nPressure to comply is being exerted on the Finance Ministry by various quarters, particularly senior officials at the OPM.\nHowever, the Finance Minister, Edward Scicluna, has been advised not to issue the permit as this would constitute a clear breach of the Immovable Property (Acquisition by non-residents) Act.\n\u201cSuch a permit, if granted, will be totally illegal and the Finance Ministry would be breaching the law and might be challenged.

The Sunday Times of Malta can confirm that it has not.\nRules for foreign-owned property\nDuring the pre-2004 accession negotiations with the EU, Malta successfully negotiated a special deal with Brussels to protect Maltese citizens from foreign land and property speculators.\nAccording to EU treaties, all EU citizens are to be considered as equal, but Malta obtained a special derogation to limit how much property EU citizens could buy and for what reasons.\nUnder this arrangement, all EU citizens can only acquire a second home in Malta so long as they use it for strictly residential purposes. They are not even allowed to buy a property to rent out.\nThrough the AIP permit mechanism, EU citizens require a permit from the Finance Ministry before they even sign a contract to buy their property.\nThe rules, however, are even more stringent for third country citizens \u2013 such as the Dubai sheik. They are only allowed to buy a single property on the island and use it exclusively for personal residential purposes.\nThe only exception to the rule are properties in so-called Special Designated Areas (SDA), mainly high-end development projects such as Portmaso and Tigne\u2019, where no limits on sale of properties apply.\nHowever, the Mistra Village is not included in the list of SDAs.\nThe Mistra Village story so far\nOriginally built in the 1980s, Mistra Village was developed into a tourist complex by the Corinthia Group of Companies. Though at first it was successful, it had started to decline in popularity along the years, closing doors in the early 2000s.\nThe land was later sold by Corinthia to Gemxija Crown Ltd, owned by the Montebello brothers, who had also built the not so successful Marsa A3 Towers project and bought the Jerma Palace to turn into apartments.\nHowever, serious financial difficulties hit the group and despite a permit granted in 2013 to develop the Mistra Village into apartment blocks, the development never took off.\nLast January, the Planning Authority issued a renewal of the permit giving Gemxija Crown five more years to start.\nThe Dubai sheik then filed his application with the Finance Ministry to be granted a special AIP permit that would allow him to take over the project. The OPM was aware of what was going on.\nThe plan\nAccording to the latest development permit, the former tourist village is to be turned into a residential development consisting of 744 apartments, 1,800 square metres of retail space, 1,000 square metres of restaurants and a car park for 1,600 cars.\nThe Dubai sheik, if granted the government\u2019s green light, would be spending hundreds of millions on the project that would culminate in selling apartments to Maltese and foreign buyers.\nThe total floorspace footprint of the project is 134,600 square metres, equivalent to the size of 19 full-size football pitches.\nWhat the law states\nAny non-resident person wishing to acquire immovable property in Malta needs to fill in the necessary forms issued by the Finance Ministry.\nA dwelling house is to be solely used as a residence by the applicant and his family and for no other purpose. It may not be sold in part or converted into more than one dwelling house.\nA garage must be used solely as such by the applicant and his family or as an extension to be integrated with the applicant\u2019s existing dwelling.\nA plot of land must be developed into one complete single residence ready for occupation within two years from the issue of the permit and must be used solely as a residence by the applicant and his family and for no other reason.\n\u00a0", "comment_count": 103, "id": 2618}]
