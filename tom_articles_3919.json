A few months later, the keys were returned to the owners and the property given back in a poor state. The owners claimed the house was not habitable, pointing their fingers at the government, and took their case to Strasbourg.\nThe European judges, including Chief Justice Emeritus Vincent De Gaetano, decided that the redress provided by the Constitutional Court did not offer sufficient relief to the owners.\nThe European Court awarded the owners a total of \u20ac13,400 in moral and material damages as well as to cover expenses.\nThe house in Qormi, belonging to Edward Zammit Maempel and Cynthia Zammit Maempel, had been granted on emphyteusis for 21 years to a couple in late 1986 and was eventually requisitioned on the last day of 1992 and allocated to another couple.
