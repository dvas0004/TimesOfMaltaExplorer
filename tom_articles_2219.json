41, from Vittoriosa had allegedly got out of his Volkswagen and punched a plainclothes policeman who had stopped to warn him over his allegedly dangerous driving manoeuvres.\nThe victim had been out

violently resisting the police officer.\nMagistrate Donatella Frendo Dimech\u00a0concluded that there was \u201can absolute lack of evidence\u201d to prove that at the time of the incident, the victim had been executing a lawful order by a competent authority, thereby acquitting the accused of this charge.\nAs for the rest of the charges, to which the accused had registered an admission, at a not-so-early stage, the court declared him guilty.\nWhen meting out punishment, the court, whilst taking note of the accused\u2019s tainted criminal record and all the circumstances of the case, also noted a Social Inquiry Report drawn up by a probation officer who said that Mr Attard had embarked upon the right path, had a fixed job and a stable life, buttressed by a supportive family.\nThe

250-hour community service order which would best serve the interests of society at large.\nAs for a claim for damages registered by the policeman in the course of the criminal proceedings, the court observed that a number of receipts issued by two private health clinics and a pharmacy, as well as a specialist\u2019s email requesting payment for a psychiatric report, gave no indication of the nature of the medical consultation.\nNor had these documents been authenticated by the injured party or a representative of the clinics concerned, the court observed.\nThe victim had also requested

the person liable to a minimum prison term of 3 years, would have their claim for damages before the criminal court, capped at \u20ac10,000.\nThe wording of the law, as affected by the said

The youngest speakers are in their 50s and Unesco has included it in its list of severely endangered languages.\nUntil recently there was no documented literature or poetry in Sanna, but then Maltese linguist Prof. Alexander Borg came along.\nHis involvement with the Cypriot Maronites was prompted by his study of Arabic dialectology at the Hebrew University, engendered in a scholarly interest in the striking cultural and linguistic parallels with Maltese \u2013 also a diaspora variety of Arabic spoken by Christians. His sensitivity to the unfortunate fate meted out to Christian communities in the Middle East also urged him to help the community.\nProf. Borg told The Sunday Times of Malta that the Greek-Turkish hostilities of 1974 resulted in the dispersion of the Arabic-speaking Maronite community, which made it difficult for the transmission of its ancient language to the younger generation.\nHe was able to undertake post-doctoral work for some years with the support of the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation (Germany), and his study of Cypriot Maronite Arabic has proven to be a fascinating discovery process.\nSurvival prospects are not very bright\nAlthough the Cypriot Maronites are often regarded as a Lebanese diaspora, his research demonstrated that their origins are in north Syria with close links to Mesopotamia. Significantly, the continuity of Cypriot Arabic with the traditions of eastern Christianity was also evident in its substratal formal links drawing on a variety of Western Aramaic, he noted.\n\u201cFrom a human angle, the situation of the Maronite speakers of Cypriot Maronite Arabic evokes striking historical parallels with those of sectarian minority groups in the adjacent mainland that speak highly distinctive vernaculars, such as the Aramaic-speaking Christian and Jewish communities traditionally residing in southeast Turkey, northeast Syria, north Iraq, northwest Iran and Egypt.\n\u201cBefore the Bush and Blair invasion, Iraq had about 300,000 mostly Christian speakers of Aramaic. I can only shudder at the present fate meted out to many thousands of Aramaic speakers from that country and Syria,\u201d he added.\nWhen it came to proposing an orthography, although some were inclined to adopt the Greek alphabet, Prof. Borg opted for a slightly modified version of the Latin alphabet.\nThe use of this orthography seems to have caught on and there is now an attempt to produce translations of selections from the Bible. Apart from its use in Maltese, the Latin alphabet had also been used to transcribe Andalusi Arabic in the 16th century.\nSadly, survival prospects for the language are not very bright, but, given its intrinsic interest and the feelings of its speaker community, it would be irresponsible to neglect its documentation, he told this newspaper.\nSanna has been tendered the status of a minority language by the European Commission and Prof. Borg hopes that his own work will serve the needs of linguistic research from the perspectives of Arabic language history and comparative Semitics.", "comment_count": 7, "id": 3652}, {"keywords": "", "author": "Denise Grech", "article_body": "Activists camping outside the Planning Authority's offices have decided to extend their stay until they feel their message against the building of more fuel stations outside development zones is heard.\u00a0 \u00a0\nSome 25 activists have been camped in front of the offices for three days to express their outrage that a promised new fuel stations policy has not yet been published.\nIn a meeting on Friday, Transport Minister Ian Borg said the fuel stations policy review will be published in April.\nActivists said they were unhappy with this response, saying they had been promised the review for a long time- to no avail.\nWhile they originally planned to stay over the weekend, they have decided to extend their stay \u201cuntil we feel that the message has come across\u201d Moviment Graffiti activist Victoria Pisani said.\n\u201cToday is Freedom Day- and we are demanding freedom from developers,\u201d Friends of the Earth director Martin Galea de Giovanni said.\nDin l-Art Helwa\u2019s Stanley Farrugia Randon said people were dying as a result of what the government deemed to be development.\n\u201cEach year, as a doctor, I keep seeing more pollution\u201d he said, adding it was a big anomaly for the government to say it wanted fewer cars while supported more fuel stations.", "comment_count": 15, "id": 3653}, {"keywords": "", "author": "", "article_body": "A 58-year-old motorcyclist was seriously injured in a crash in Birzebbu\u0121a on Sunday afternoon.\nThe police said the accident took place at 1.30pm in Qajjenza Road and involved a Mercedes driven by an 82-year-old German man who resides in Birzebbu\u0121a and a Honda motorbike that was being driven by the 58-year-old man who resides in Marsaxlokk.\nA magisterial inquiry is under way.\u00a0", "comment_count": 1, "id": 3654}, {"keywords": "", "author": "", "article_body": "Marie-Louise Coleiro Preca has thanked the people as she prepares to end her presidency on Thursday.\n\"It has been my honour and privilege to have had this opportunity to be able to share with you, as one of you, these past five years as President of the Republic of Malta,\" she said in a message.\u00a0\n\"Throughout that time, I have worked hard to uphold my constitutional duties, because I believe that democracy is the best means that we have, in today\u2019s world, to celebrate human dignity and to safeguard the observance of human rights and peace, in our communities and in Maltese society.\n\"Serving as your President has been a privilege, and I am grateful to the representatives of the people through Parliament, where for the first time the nomination of President of Malta was reached through unanimous agreement, both by government and opposition, not-with-standing my coming from the government benches.\nI hope this consensus will continue for my successors\n\"I hope this consensus will continue for my successors, because the President of our nation should have no party but should serve the people, with loyalty and with a conscience that goes beyond any desire for popularity.\"\nThe President thanked the government and opposition for having received her criticisms with respect and accepted a number of her proposals and suggestions.\n\"Above all, I wish to thank the entire people of Malta and Gozo for the respect and support they have given me.

Is the Christian faith in danger of dying?\nYouths believe something, commit to an ideal, and are moved to act only when they are fully convinced. We see this happening when they lead the way on environmental issues.\nIt\u2019s the same with faith. Youths will only trust the Christian faith and feel they belong in the Church when they are convinced of its authenticity \u2013 and in this regard we all have a duty as part of the \u2018Church\u2019.\nDeclining Mass numbers per se are not indicative of the level of faith, spirituality and commitment of youths today. Mass attendance is definitely important but it is only one criterion on which to gauge faith among youths.\nOne should distinguish between believing and belonging. Many Maltese youths still embrace human and religious values, such as the existence of God, the value and dignity of human life, Christian marriage, tolerance, a sense of justice, seeking meaning and cherishing the spiritual dimension of the human experience.\nThe challenge is how to transform the individualistic dimension of faith into the value of belonging to a living community of faith. Unless faith is understood as trust, it risks marginalisation. Faith is, above all, a lifestyle. The future of the Christian faith is not tied to individualistic views, as some would think.\nThe more multi-ethnic Malta becomes, the more we need acceptance, tolerance and mutual respect. These values do not spring out of nowhere. Faith embraces culture. Although faith is reliable irrespective of it being demonstrated, living up to one\u2019s faith and convictions makes it credible.\nWhat is imperative today is a faith that is explored, questioned and put into practice. This is what youths normally do \u2013 they question their faith seriously, return to it, or strive to deepen and integrate it with the rest of their life. What is missing are the catalysts of faith who can inspire younger generations to be able to trust and to come to terms with themselves and God.\nDespite children attending religion lessons in schools and pre-Holy Communion catechism, and a large proportion attending Church schools, is the Church missing the opportunity to \u2018catch them while they are young\u2019? Does the religious formation of children need a radical reform?\nThe Church must definitely overhaul its religious formation. Formation that leads to faith merely on the level of rational enquiry is very limiting. Religion lessons in schools are about the study of religion; they are not a lived experience. Catechism should be different. It is meant to accompany and mentor the journey of faith. The humus of catechism is not the class but the living community of faith that accompanies the person. And I think this is where we are failing.\nA question to be asked is whether we have vibrant Christian communities in our Church structures. If adolescents fail to attend catechism classes, are unimpressed or opt out of Sunday Mass, we should ask why. A proper strategy needs to be implemented to invest in building true Christian communities living and incarnating the Gospel worldview.\nI would suggest three ideas. First, we need to motivate them to understand why a personal friendship with Jesus matters. We need to make room for imagination, particularly to relate faith to personal talents and experiences.\nSecondly, religious formation should be seen in terms of giving space to God\u2019s reign among us, for example through commitment to social justice and building a better future for our common home. Most young people love to reach out to the sick, the poor or the environment.\nThe Church must definitely overhaul its religious formation\nThirdly, we could do more to combine faith formation and liturgy. This might lead to practical results concerning attitudes and values.\nCertain Catholic youth movements, such as the MUSEUM and the Youth Fellowship, are flourishing. Religious courses for adults run by the MSSP are well attended. What are they doing right?\nThe MUSEUM, the MSSP Oratory and other groups, movements and religious \u2013 and there are many \u2013 are spaces where there is a vibrant, living community of faith formed in faith through catechetical formation, intellectual knowledge of the faith, and which then provides the experiential dimension.\nThis is clear evidence that faith is still alive. Youths yearn for truth and authenticity. They flock together where their needs, dreams and aspirations are addressed meaningfully and persuasively. If we want to speak of hope in the Church, we should talk about the special ingredients that work wonders: persuasion, joy and belonging.\nBy persuasion, I mean committed Christians who seek to live their faith as best as they can. Faith matters to their life and they give hope to others. As Pope Francis says, Christian faith needs to be characterised by a joy that is felt and transmitted.\nPriestly vocations are plummeting. Does the Church need to abandon priestly celibacy and allow women to become priests in order for the faith to survive?\nIf there is a dwindling sense of belonging to the Church, then we cannot expect otherwise! If we wish to have more vocations, then we need people who encounter the Risen Christ personally in a vibrant, living Christian community of faith, who would then be ready to believe in the beauty of the Christian ideal and lead with a generous heart.\nTo foster the faith, our discourse should not necessarily be on women priests and celibacy, but rather on our readiness and decision to risk leaving behind everything to follow the Lord. This is only possible if there is a real encounter with the Risen Lord. Christian families play a part in helping young people to discern their vocation and to steer their life in the right direction.\nHave the clerical sex abuse scandals further undermined the Church\u2019s authority and credibility? Or could they ironically lead to a stronger Church?\nIt pains me to talk about these scandals because it is really unfair to blame the Church, that is, the community of believers, without considering the commitment to the faith and the good work the Church does. Those in authority should be held responsible and accountable for wrong decisions. They should be pushing for greater accountability.\nThe emerging Church needs to mature, to have well-formed priests who understand their vocation not in terms of power, privilege and authority, but as a service that promotes the gifts and discipleship of the whole people of God.\nClericalism is said to be the root cause. But clericalism is not about being a priest but about seeking power within Church structures. And power begets abuse and arrogance. And it is not just priests who are in danger of falling into a culture of clericalism but also pastoral ministers and female religious.\nIt is important to have in the Church\u2019s structures a more organised and empowered active collaboration with formed lay people co-responsible in the formation and leadership of the Church as well as in ecclesial ministry. All this may paradoxically help the Church prepare its candidates to become good preachers, prepared leaders of worship, collaborative leaders, public representatives of the Church and practitioners of pastoral charity.\nMaltese society displays the characteristics of \u2018amoral familism\u2019, namely a self-interested, family-centric society prepared to sacrifice principles such as integrity, good governance and the public good for one\u2019s family\u2019s interests and political tribalism. Is this partly a failure of the Church to inculcate true moral fibre, values and principles in the faithful?\nI would certainly not blame directly the Church for a weakening of society\u2019s general moral fibre or morality in general. I would, however, say that the Church can do more to strengthen the human values of honesty, trustworthiness, solidarity and justice.\nWe should not remain silent in the face of domestic violence or bullying at any age. Civil and Church authorities should not act as if there is nothing wrong with stealing, character assassination, corruption, fake news, tax evasion, environmental degradation and taking false oaths in court. We need leaders who have the inner strength to stand up for what they believe is right, even in face of adversity.\nWhereas the Maltese have a reputation for being a hospitable people, today so many seem to be xenophobic, racist or unconcerned with the drowning of immigrants in the seas around us. Is this another sign of failure of Malta\u2019s Christian faith?\nThe Church has nothing to do with xenophobia or racism that are unfortunately subtly eroding our civil and moral fibre. But yes, we should ask how it is possible that xenophobia and racism exist in a traditionally Catholic country. Something, somewhere went wrong.\nThe Church is committed to fight against stigmatisation of foreigners, but it certainly can do more to raise its awareness campaign. How can we ignore Pope Francis\u2019 appeal to foster a couture of tolerance, inclusion and encounter?\nI can think of two ways how these can be overcome \u2013 political action and community engagement. What is most needed in society is respect, particularly when people are visibly different in terms of language, customs and lifestyle.\nThe recent reform of the IVF law, which gave the green light to the freezing of embryos, was seen by many as a precursor to the introduction of abortion in Malta. Is the Church in Malta losing the argument against its legalisation?\nThe Church is the main institution that manifests its constant effort to promote a culture of life and to protect human life at every stage of its development. During the public debate on embryo freezing, the Church did not mince words to indicate that this medical practice will lead to the gradual erosion of respect for a human being from the very first moment of fertilisation or conception.\u00a0\nA caring society defends those who are voiceless and vulnerable. The destruction of the human embryo and the termination of vulnerable people by euthanasia or assisted suicide is a sign of degradation, not progress. The Church cannot shirk its responsibility in this matter.\nThe Church\u2019s message today is one of many divergent ones in a cacophony of mainstream and social media. What, if anything, can it do better to get its message across to different audiences?\nThe Church needs to think outside the box. It should go to the peripheries and if it cannot go that far, it should at least make it to the public square. It should offer discussion, not ready-made answers. There is no reason to fear pushing boundaries to ensure the Church is able to have a conversation with the contemporary world.\nWhile certain issues are considered as hot potatoes I always keep in mind what the French philosopher Paul Ricoeur held, that Christians should always be prepared to talk to two audiences, believers or not, to whom they should convey something meaningful.\nHow many of the Faculty of Theology\u2019s students are preparing for the priesthood and how many are lay people?\nThe Church needs to think outside the box\nWe have 154 students, of whom 10 per cent are preparing themselves for priestly ministry. This year four will become priests on April 27 at St John\u2019s Co-Cathedral.\nIn general, three-fourths of our students are following a postgraduate degree, mainly in bioethics, spirituality/spiritual companionship, matrimonial canon law, youth ministry, Catholic school leadership and theology/religious studies. Morning students specialise in philosophical studies, theology and pastoral psychology.\nWhat changes would you like to introduce as Dean of your faculty? Is the faculty planning any new courses or other initiatives?\nI would like to see a versatile faculty re-connecting with various pastoral or social entities, re-proposing spiritual well-being and re-configuring spirituality in leadership and business.\nWe are working on two new courses. In the coming days, we will launch a new MA in Environmental Ethics. The programme will identify and analyse the deeply human philosophical, ethical and political underpinnings of the current state of cultural, biological and ecological degradation, as well as of the human potential for creating and safeguarding sustainable human ecologies for the benefit of both present and future generations.\nSecondly, we are finalising the Certificate in Safeguarding of Children and Young People, which will promote best practice and equip people engaged in pastoral ministry and other work with children and young people with the abilities and skills needed to safeguard them.\nThe abuse of children and young people needs to be confronted and tackled on many levels, particularly through education and training in safeguarding of all those involved in pastoral care, education, social work, voluntary work, healthcare, sports and other recreational activities.\nDoes the faculty have a wider role in Maltese society?\nAbsolutely. In July, it will hold a strategic planning session on how to have a wider role in Maltese society. We want to explore how we can connect with various institutions. To read and respond to the signs of the times, as a faculty we want to arm our people with the culture of dialogue as well as play an active role in the creation of an integrated and reconciled society.\nThe faculty is engaged in public consultancy on various legislation and policies, particularly through position papers written with other academics. We intend to continue this good practice. And we will continue to reach out and respond to the needs of the community through a multidisciplinary approach in line with the vision of the University of Malta.", "comment_count": 9, "id": 3657}, {"keywords": "", "author": "Denise Grech ", "article_body": "Malta is being taken over by outsiders, 40 years after Freedom Day, because its economy has become overly-dependant on foreigners, Opposition leader Adrian Delia said on Sunday\u00a0\nHe told a PN activity in Kalkara that he had joined the President and the prime minister in laying flowers on the Freedom Monument in Vittoriosa, but the irony was that this government had made Malta dependent on foreigners.\n\nAccording to what the prime minister himself had said, Malta\u2019s pensions could only be sustained if foreign workers were brought to Malta.

the Council of Europe\u2019s anti-corruption watchdog has warned.\n\nIn a draft copy of an evaluation report carried out by Group of States Against Corruption (Greco) seen by The Sunday Times of Malta, evaluators said it was clear Malta needed to increase its capacity to deal with allegations of corruption and other offences involving government officials.\nThe lack of action against top officials facing corruption allegations conveyed a feeling in the public that senior officials benefit from a total impunity for their actions.\n\n\nJustice Minister Owen Bonnici announced during the same week the as yet unpublished Greco report was adopted by the Council of Europe (CoE) that the government would be hiving off the prosecution role from the Attorney General, as per one of the many recommendations by the CoE\u2019s advisory body, the Venice Commission.\nThe timing of Dr Bonnici\u2019s announcement about the reforms could be seen as a bid by the government to take some of the string out of the Greco report.\nFormer Prime Minister Alfred Sant expressed his disagreement in the European Parliament last week about the \u201cquick commitment\u201d by the government to adopt the changes.\n\u2018Crisis culminated with assassination\u2019\nThe report charts how former Police Commissioner Michael Cassar went out on sick leave and resigned upon receiving a request from the FIAU to investigate the Prime Minister\u2019s chief of staff Keith Schembri and Tourism Minister Konrad Mizzi in April 2016.\nIt details how Prime Minister Joseph Muscat carried out a Cabinet reshuffle, in which the officials involved were retained instead of dismissed.\n\u201cThe crisis culminated in October 2017 with the assassination of Daphne Caruana Galizia, who had reported extensively about the number of anomalies in the conduct of public affairs in recent years,\u201d the report says.\nThe report strikes an unimpressed tone about the arrest of three people \u201cconsidered by many as mere executants acting at the request of influential persons\u201d.\nThe Commissioner for Standards\u2019 reluctance to touch the 17 Black revelations also raised questions from Greco.\nAcknowledging that the law governing the Commissioner precludes him from investigating actions that took place before the new laws on standards in public life came into force, Greco argues that it is an ongoing controversy.\n\u201cThe Greco evaluation team would find it particularly strange that no such action were to be taken although the situation continues in the present,\u201d the reports says on 17 Black.\nGreco\u2019s damning assessment in quotes:\n\u25a0 On institutional weakness:\n\u201cMalta has on paper an impressive arsenal of public institutions involved in checks and balance.\n\u201cHowever, their effectiveness is being questioned as the country was confronted in recent years with an unprecedented wave of controversies concerning the integrity of senior government officials up to the highest level.\u201d\n\u25a0 On the centralisation of power:\n\u201cDuring the interviews, the Greco evaluation team heard repeatedly that these bodies [meant to hold government to account] \u2013 with a few exceptions \u2013 suffered from a lack of courage, accountability and real means to accomplish their duties.\n\u201cThere is also a clear perception in Malta that political support currently prevails over the enforcement of the law and the general interest.\n\u201cThis is of course facilitated by the current institutional overweight of the government and especially the Prime Minister, in particular when it comes to appointments (and dismissals) in such essential State functions.\u201d\n\u25a0 On the criminal justice system:\n\u201cMalta\u2019s criminal justice system relies excessively on the central role of the police, which is competent both for the investigation and prosecution of criminal offences.\n\u201cThe police has the reputation of being traditionally heavily subjected to the executive branch of power and that its ability to deal with sensitive or major cases depended largely on the capacities, determination and self-assertiveness of the head of the institution to lead the work despite external pressures.\n\u201cThis was repeatedly underlined during interviews and in media material consulted by the Greco evaluation team.\u201d\n\u25a0 On the Permanent Commission against Corruption:\n\u201cThe Greco evaluation team\u2019s conclusion is that in the current context, there is no added value with the Permanent Commission against Corruption (which could be abolished).\n\u201cThe criminal investigation and prosecution system should be reformed and be made more responsive and effective, with the prosecutors being given the faculty to direct investigations and the responsibility for taking such cases to court. This would obviously require structural changes.\u201d\n\u25a0 On the police:\n\u201cThe present report lists a number of desirable improvements, including more robust ethical standards, a clear merit-based approach for career decisions and promotions, the introduction of a communication policy, a more robust training system must be developed and so on.\n\u201cThe independent Police Complaints Board should be strengthened and become an effective control body. And to counter corruption and other possible issues, a clear policy on reporting and disclosures, combined with protective measures for those who blow the whistle, is needed in the force.\u201d\n\u25a0 On the Commissioner for Standards:\n\u201cThe media reported that on the first day in office, the Commissioner stated that he might not investigate the case of 17 Black, one of the central legal entities suspected of being involved in secret dealings with currently serving government officials and there are fears that the Commissioner for Standards in Public Life would remain a weak body.\n\u201cThe Greco evaluation team would find it particularly strange that no such action were to be taken although the situation continues in the present.\u201d\nA look at some of Greco\u2019s recommendations\nThat a strategy be developed and implemented to increase the capacity, authority and public accountability of State institutions entrusted with regulatory and control functions in relation to the management of public resources.\nThat the criminal investigation and prosecution system be reformed along the lines identified by the Venice Commission in its assessment from December 2018, without retaining the parallel jurisdiction of the Permanent Commission against Corruption and ii) that it be made clear for criminal investigative bodies that the launching of an inquiry or investigation does not require that evidence is readily submitted to them.\nThat detailed rules be introduced on the way in which persons exercising top executive functions interact with lobbyists and other third parties seeking to influence the public decision-making process; and (ii) that sufficient information about the purpose of these contacts be disclosed to the public in a systematic, timely and easily accessible manner, such as the identity of the person(s) with whom (or on whose behalf) the meeting(s) took place and the specific subject matter(s) of the discussion.\nThat the current regime of asset declaration be further developed by (i) extending to all persons entrusted with top executive functions, including persons of trust who are associated with a minister\u2019s decision-making, the duty to file a detailed declaration of assets with the Commissioner for Standards in Public Life, considering including information on the spouses (it being understood that this last information would not necessarily be made public), and (ii) ensuring that all asset declarations are made systematically, easily and publicly accessible online.\nThe status of persons appointed to positions of trust be clearly identified and regulated, and that those very few who would be appointed to such positions and who would perform top executive functions be required to comply with the highest standards of integrity, including as regards rules of conduct, conflicts of interest, declaratory obligations and supervision by the Commissioner for standards in public life.\nA dedicated anti-corruption strategy be adopted and implemented for the Maltese Police Force, based on proper risk assessments, so as to promote a culture of integrity and to restore public trust in the Force through a robust set of rules, effective compliance, merit-based career systems, operational independence and political neutrality, as well as increased awareness and gender balance at all levels.\nGerman MEP: Time for the European Commission to act\nGerman Greens MEP Sven Giegold in a reaction to the report said on Sunday that the European Commission needed to act about Malta.\n\"The EU Commission must make the situation in Malta a top priority and initiate a procedure under Article 7 of the EU Treaties. So far, the responsible Vice-President and Social Democratic commission president-candidate for the European elections (Hans Timmermans) has referred the matter to Justice Commissioner Jurov\u00e1.

Initial reactions indicated people were already keen on the idea, with 300 downloads being recorded in one week alone, he said.\nThe initiative could not have come at a better time, with statistics increasingly showing Malta still has a long way to go before it can claim to be an environmentally-friendly country.\u00a0\nMunicipal waste figures show only a slither of the country\u2019s waste was recycled until 2017.

This happened, though it is not specified in the report, in the run-up to the election.\nIt also emerges from the findings that, rather than recruiting the extra employees through normal government channels, ministry officials recommended candidates to the contractor \u2013 JF Services Ltd \u2013 who obliged, hiring them and then billing the government for their wages and related costs.\nThis recruitment exercise is costing taxpayers almost \u20ac2 million in additional expenses a year. The place of residence of the new recruits is not listed in the Auditor General\u2019s report.\nMinistry officials recommended candidates to the contractor\nThe NAO noted that although the contract, which kept being renewed through a direct order approved by the Finance Ministry, was strictly for clerks, those recruited in the period under review were not required. To mitigate the situation, most of the new employees were given other duties varying from drivers, to helping in the kitchen and carrying out security duties outside the scope of the contract.\nSome of those recruited did not possess the minimum of qualifications to perform their job. Electricians were recruited without the necessary licences and had to be given other jobs to avoid problems while the government had to hire other electricians and, of course, pay them.\nRead: Mt Carmel Hospital hired twice as many clerks as planned, then gave them different duties\nWhen asked how the extra staff members were recruited by the contractor and on whose request, none of the hospital officials could give a straight reply and most insisted the recruitment happened before their time at the mental health institution.\nPaul Dalli, the hospital\u2019s former chief operating officer who now works at the Health Ministry, said \u201cindividuals were referred to him by the Health Ministry\u201d and he would then \u201crecommend to the service provider [the private contractor] to be recruited and deployed at Mt Carmel\u201d.\nPressed by the NAO to say why the ministry took it upon itself to find employees for the contractor instead of the other way round, ministry officials replied that \u201csuch an intervention was required since the contractor was finding it very difficult to source the necessary human resources\u201d.\n\nHospital officials were unable to say why a contract for clerks was used to engage all types of personnel who were not required. However, CEO Stephen Sultana, the Labour mayor of Santa Venera, confirmed that those recruited were still on the contractor\u2019s payroll and were still paid by the government.\nAdmitting that some of those recruited were not up to standard, he conceded that \u201cit is very difficult to dismiss non-performing individuals [employed with the contractor] when these would have been referred to the service provider by the hospital itself for recruitment\u201d.\nThe Times of Malta reported last November that procurement rules were being ignored by Mount Carmel when securing contracts. It was also reported that this also applied to contracts for farmed-out services such as cleaners, nurses, carers and security personnel.\nMinistry reacts\u00a0\nIn a statement issued on Friday afternoon, the Health Ministry said that the hospital had increased its staff numbers by 120 in the year under review - 81 support workers and 37 clinicians.\u00a0\nOver the past decade, the ministry said, the hospital had added an average of 83 people every year. The largest increase had happened between 2011 and 2012, when 304 people were added to the hospital's books.\u00a0\nThe ministry said that many of the workers recruited in 2017 were needed \"to start addressing the serious deficiencies which had accumulated over the years\".\u00a0\nSecurity personnel had clerical contracts\nWhy the NAO study?\nIn a report issued in May 2018, the NAO observed that outsourced security personnel at Mount Carmel Hospital were governed by a contract for clerical services. This led it to conduct an in-depth review to obtain a clearer picture on how the hospital was managing the contract.\nWhat was procured?\nIn July 2015, JF Services Ltd was tasked with providing 60 full-time clerical staff on a two-year contract.\nWhat happened then?\nIn May 2017, when the contract was supposedly coming to a close and Malta was in a full electoral mode (the election was held on June 3), a new call for tenders was expected to be issued. Instead, the contract was renewed through a direct order against public procurement rules.\nThe number of clerks at the hospital shot up from 60 to 156 in May 2017.\nWho recruited the clerks?\nThe NAO found no documentation to justify the increase. However, according to the former hospital COO, rather than of JF Services providing the extra recruits it was the Health Ministry that was recommending the new employees to the contractor and put on the government\u2019s wage bill.\nWere the clerks necessary?\nNo. So much so that the NAO found that the ministry was using the clerks\u2019 contract to recruit all kinds of unrelated personnel. These included security officers, drivers, carpenters, kitchen helpers, plasterers and tile setters.\nAre all these still on the payroll?\nYes.\nWhat did this exercise cost?\nAccording to the contract, taxpayers were forking out \u20ac27,000 a week for the contract but by the end of June 2017, election month, the cost ballooned to \u20ac62,000 a week. Over a 12-month period, this recruitment cost taxpayers an extra \u20ac1.8 million.\nWas this the only case?\nNo. The NAO found similar cases of abuse in at least another contract related to cleaning services, which is still in force through a direct order, against procurement rules.\nThe Times of Malta is informed that the same system is being adopted for other contracts including for the supply of nurses, carers and security personnel at the same institution.", "comment_count": 57, "id": 3717}, {"keywords": "", "author": "", "article_body": "A mother and a daughter from G\u0127axaq have been reported missing.\nThe police were alerted to the disappearance of Marija Lourdes Bonnici and her daughter Angele Bonnici on Wednesday afternoon.\nThey were last seen the day before at around 7am at their G\u0127axaq residence.\u00a0\nAny information about the two can be passed on to the police, in a confidential manner, on 2122 4001 or\u00a0119.\nInformation can also be passed on to the officers at the \u017bejtun police station.", "comment_count": 5, "id": 3718}]
