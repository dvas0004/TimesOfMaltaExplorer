Any station that remains unused for three years must be demolished, the new policy is proposing.\u00a0\nGraffiti notes concerns\nIn its reaction, Graffiti noted that although the revised policy states that pending fuel station applications should be decided on the basis of this revised policy, \"there is no mention of the applications due to be heard in the period up to the approval of the new policy. There is no sense in proposing a change while allowing applications already submitted to continue being decided according to the old policy,\" the group said.\nSince it may take many months before any changes are made, the group said the PA should halt any and all applications for fuel service stations until the proposed policy comes into effect.\nIt observed that the draft revised policy features several improvements over the one currently in force. The options for take-up of ODZ land are significantly more limited.\u00a0\nGraffiti said however, that the proposed policy \"requires no limit on size and no minimum distance between fuel stations\", including those in Areas of Containment - ODZ sites that have already been subjected to development.\u00a0\n\"This may open the door to massive complexes of commercial services for cars, using the excuse of dispensing fuel to justify the take up of large parcels of land,\" it warned.\n\"Fuel stations should be limited in size, with other commercial activities related to car servicing operating under a commercial policy. The current and proposed policies both allow this abuse,\" it said.\u00a0\nThe proposed policy also allows for the upgrading of facilities for ancillary services. This seems to open the door for fuel stations to expand for reasons unrelated to the fuel dispensing function, again providing a loophole that can be exploited.\n\"The fact that ODZ land remains available for development, notwithstanding the increased constraints in that regard, continues to devalue the ODZ classification.

You are an architect yourself, at the helm of Malta\u2019s most prominent heritage and environment NGO. How much do you feel your profession is to blame for the state of the country and how can your role within Din l-Art \u0126elwa be even more effective because of what you do?\nIn my last speech as president of the Kamra tal-Periti, I told my colleagues that the ugliness we are seeing around us is also our doing. However, that is only part of the problem, and not necessarily the bigger part. In order to create the urban and rural environment that we aspire to, we need much better legislative tools to protect what we have inherited and to promote a better quality of what we are building today.\nThese legislative tools need to come from politicians who are sensitive, or sensitised, to the issues, and frankly, where are they? It is often argued that politicians have to respond to the wishes of their electorate, but good political leadership also means that one convinces one\u2019s constituents that more restraint, higher urban quality, less demolition of old houses, etc\u2026 are actually in their economic interest as well as that of their well-being.\nIn my view, the biggest culprit in the mess is the Planning Authority, and the politicians who are unwilling to let go of the attraction of controlling it \u2013 because their patronage depends on this. This is the real reason for the state of Malta\u2019s built and natural heritage.\nPA has many design guidelines, but not a single one of them requires developments to be beautiful\nWhether my background as an architect can help DL\u0126 to be more effective now remains to be seen. I will certainly do my best.\nHave you ever found yourself having to pander to a client\u2019s needs, which may not necessarily fit into your values and standards when it comes to quality architecture and a respect for the environment? Do you understand this predicament many architects may find themselves in?\nYes, I certainly understand the predicament. It is very difficult, especially for a young professional, wishing to enter the market, after long years at university, to take a stand against what the client wants, especially if the client is a seasoned developer. It is, indeed, not even fair to expect this.\nWhat we really need is that values and standards are not just personal choices but national requirements. Therefore, architects are not left on their own when they are not comfortable with what is being demanded of them \u2013 particularly if these client needs are allowed by policy and are, therefore, legitimate.\nOf course, this means that the architect has to have the moral courage to reject any \u2018twisting\u2019 of policy to suit the client. It is not correct professional behaviour to plot a route through the many gaps in our myriad policies and guidelines in order to achieve this objective. The problem is that the planning process has become a legal process \u2013 it is all about whether a particular comma allows or prohibits a particular proposal. It is rarely about the quality of the product itself.\nI have been in this predicament myself and I must say there were a couple, very early, of minor projects that I am not, in hindsight, particularly proud of. I can also state that, when my practice was established, I could refuse, for example, to take on at least two lucrative high-rise projects that I believed were wrong \u2013 even if, with some stretching, one could say they were within \u2018policy\u2019.\nAs the Dean of the Faculty of the Built Environment at the University of Malta, lecturing on architecture and urban design, what are you seeing in the next generation of architects? What are you teaching them? What is the most important lesson you want them to learn?\nI think there are two important lessons we need to impart. The first is to be critical and the second to have integrity.\nDesign talent needs a fertile base in which to flourish and this base is constituted by the environmental and cultural context in which students grow up. The students who register for our courses, with the ambition of becoming periti, always carry with them the baggage of what they have seen in their home towns and villages; this is what forms their likes and dislikes. They are often, I have found, immune to the ugliness that pervades. However, once we break through that \u2018shell\u2019, we find that there is a lot of talent, a lot of awareness of what is wrong and what could be better.\nNot all students are, of course, of the same ability. The question, therefore, is how to ensure that the better students, and hence young professionals, get the more important commissions. Interestingly enough, private clients, wishing to build houses for themselves, do seek out such talented professionals, but for public projects this does not happen. It is mostly about political patronage, or on the basis of who is cheapest.\nThis is why I have militated, within the KTP, for Malta to adopt an Architectural Policy which, for example, would require that commissions for publicly funded projects are invariably awarded after design contests.\nOver the last years, we have presented final year students with local sites that need attention, such as Marsa, Qawra, Gozo, and invited them to collectively study their problems, propose strategies and then formulate their thesis project within those strategies. The Marsa project was a particularly important and successful one \u2013 and we even mounted a presentation to the Planning Authority and the local community in the old power station. As a whole, it was a beautiful proposal \u2013 which, unfortunately, was ignored. A few months afterwards, the power station started to be demolished!\nYou\u2019ve just stepped out of the role of president of the\u00a0KTP. How much do these two roles overlap and how much can you continue the work of one within the other, or work together?\nI have stepped down as president of KTP because, as per our statute, the term of office is two years. I am still past president on the council, for the next two years, albeit with much less duties. My role as DL\u0126 president, therefore, does overlap with that in the KTP.\nHowever, in my view, the positions taken by the KTP council that I led, and the direction we tried to give to the profession, coincide perfectly with the objectives and philosophy of DL\u0126. We want a better Malta, and this comes from preserving the good that we have, and from promoting contemporary architecture that will be our legacy for future generations.\nAmong your concerns in your previous position was the PA and, to mention just one issue, the impact its interpretation of policies is having on the country\u2019s built heritage. Do you feel you can battle this monster, responsible for some of the most despicable decisions, better now? Or have you lost some strength? Can it ever be tamed?\nIn the 1980s, the Malta Planning and Environment Authority was the result of a brave political attempt to introduce real planning processes and to combat the free-for-all that resulted from laws such as the infamous Building Development Act. Back then, I was a young professional, active in promoting the Development Planning Act.\n\u00a0Over the years, it was tweaked by successive legislatures and now it has evolved into a monster, remotely controlled by specific \u2018political\u2019 interests, and certainly not effective in promoting the common good. It has developed into an \u2018efficient\u2019 machine, where the measure of success is how fast the process of determination of applications is.\nIn fact, the PA is now a misnomer, since it does not actually do any \u2018planning\u2019, it only processes applications. In other words, it does development control. It can hardly be otherwise, when the Prime Minister himself has expressed his lack of faith in planning.\nThe drafting of policies is the main tool by which the PA determines applications. These policies are rarely site specific and are also vague enough to be interpreted as is convenient. I once had a case of a planning officer arguing in favour of my client\u2019s proposal on the basis of a specific policy and then, when the Commission indicated its intention to vote otherwise, he used the same policy to argue for refusal!\u00a0\u00a0\nThe system is all wrong. Take the issue of scheduling of iconic heritage buildings. How is it possible for scheduling proposals by the Superintendence of Cultural Heritage to depend on the votes in the executive council in the PA, where the SCH is a very small minority? And how does the PA interpret scheduling? One is required to retain the fa\u00e7ade but then \u2018policies\u2019 allow you to build a number of floors above. It takes a tour de force, if not a miracle, to make good architecture out of that policy. PA has many design guidelines but not a single one of them requires developments to be beautiful.\nYou ask me whether it can be changed. My answer is: do politicians want it to change?\nThe\u00a0KTP\u00a0council had noted that the many NGOs, scattered all over the islands, did not have the clout the development lobby has with politicians and the PA, so a loose alliance was formed to speak with a strong unified voice about heritage management and protection concerns. As president of DL\u0126, will you be taking this idea of a cross-party platform further, despite an initial lack of success? And what will it actually take to get the powers that be to listen to you, despite the strong but ineffective public interest?\nI remain of the same opinion and will continue to work in this sense. The initiative that you refer to is just over a year old. It brought together a platform of over 20 NGOs, concerned about what was happening to our built heritage, to collectively launch a Declaration of Concern. We talked to all political groups about it and, as expected, the ones in opposition supported it eagerly.\nIt took us about six months to get to talk to the Prime Minister, and two ministers, about it, and although the meeting was very cordial, with a degree of consensus too, nothing has come out of it yet. We are not done with this initiative!\nThe collaboration between NGOs has, however, continued to grow. DL\u0126, and KTP, have worked with other NGOs on a number of issues. For example, we supported Graffiti on their stand on petrol stations. Another grouping of NGOs has collectively filed a judicial letter demanding the publication of the various reports on the proposed Malta-Gozo tunnel, as well as a Strategic Environmental Assessment, as per European and local legislation.\nSome of these demands seem to have been echoed by politicians in Parliament, with, apparently, an approved commitment to publish forthwith the reports that have already been completed, and to publish promptly those that still need to be completed.\nWe will now see whether the Executive faithfully implements what Parliament has decided. However, it is symptomatic of the way things are done in this country. We have a bipartisan agreement to undertake a mega project even when critical reports, supporting or contradicting it, have not been published, and some not yet concluded.\nThe Prime Minister has gone on record saying that the PA will have the last say in approving the project; seriously, though, how on earth could the people, whom the Prime Minister himself appoints, ever contradict his stated desire to build a tunnel?\nAnd what if the consequences are not what we are being promised? Can we delete and start again?\u00a0\nDL\u0126 needs more resources, not least someone who would attend PA meetings and make a strong case against certain development applications. Many are fought but few are won. Do you feel this is a necessary tool and do you have a solution?\nThe role of DL\u0126, and other NGOs, in attending PA meetings and presenting objections, is a very important one. To a certain extent, it is generally expected that we take up the fight against all sorts of projects.\nDL\u0126 receives a regular stream of complaints and alerts about proposals to the PA, even from people who are not members of the organisation. And it is difficult to undertake this work solely on the basis of volunteers \u2013 no member of the DL\u0126 council receives a cent of remuneration for their work; and to employ somebody requires funds and resources, which are hard to come by.\nI feel the fact that we, and others such as Flimkien g\u0127al Ambjent A\u0127jar, receive so many of these complaints and worries from the general public is a clear indication they have no faith in the organisations, principally the PA, to act in defence of our built and natural heritage, as it ought to. It is a further measure of the failure of this institution.\nDL\u0126 will continue in this role, in spite of what could be perceived as a relatively poor rate of success. But we have had successes. DL\u0126, with others, was successful in getting the Environment and Planning Review Tribunal to send the Townsquare proposals back for re-design. The court has also recently upheld DL\u0126\u2019s action in the case of the Villa St Ignatius debacle.\nThe Zaha Hadid Tower is a really ugly building, crushing an iconic historic building\u2026\nWhen KTP pointed its finger at the PA for breaking its own regulations by allowing the ex-NAAFI (Sea Malta) building to be demolished, the Ombudsman ruled that KTP was right. The PA ignored the Ombudsman and, once again, three NGOs together, DL\u0126, KTP and FAA, had to take the PA to court. If we did not continue in this role, who would?\nHow would you describe the state of the Malta you have \u2018inherited\u2019 and have you ever felt it was pointless taking on this cause?\nThe state of the visual environment is in a terrible shape. It is not only about ugly buildings, or even buildings that are too high in the context of their location, or even about ODZ. It is about the shabbiness of the places where we live, the ugly hanging electricity wires, the broken pavements, the proliferation of signage poles, the exaggerated photovoltaic panel structures. It is about the acceptance that billboards are an acceptable intrusion in our landscape.\nWhen the late Judge Maurice Caruana Curran set up DL\u0126 in 1965, the situation in Malta was risking degeneration. The context was a young Malta, suddenly needing, and wanting, to become a modern nation. It was, therefore, also a politically difficult situation. How could development be balanced against preservation? Was it pointless for DL\u0126 to be set up? Where would we be today if DL\u0126 had not been set up?\nSo, how can I even accept to think that taking on this cause is pointless.\nWhat are the main goals you set out to achieve during your term of office? What do you consider to be most challenging \u2013 from\u00a0the Gozo tunnel to mega projects, land reclamation and the destruction of more historical buildings and gardens as outlined by your predecessor Maria Grazia Cassar?\u00a0And the most crucial?\nThere are so many issues, and it is unrealistic to expect that we will be able to fight on all fronts. It is not productive to always have to be the ones to say no. In fact, DL\u0126 has never been against development \u2013 only against ugly and out-of-scale development, unnecessary speculation, and destruction of our built and natural heritage.\nDL\u0126 has also endeavoured to undertake what it preached. From the first project of the \u0126al Millieri Chapel in the 1970s, it has been given, by the government, the guardianship of a number of properties, which it has restored, thanks to the support of its sponsors, and opened them to the public.\nDL\u0126 and its volunteers have saved 51 national monuments and landmarks since 1965, and all with funds raised without any help from the State. DL\u0126 was, and remains, a protagonist in the promotion and management of the Park Majjistral.\nI would dearly like to see DL\u0126 take an even more proactive role in the defence of other areas of high landscape value, not just to promote leisure and amenity, but also to promote, for example, heritage agriculture. DL\u0126 will work to promote the preparation of professional landscape plans for our countryside. We will also work to promote green open spaces in our urban areas.\nDL\u0126 also has to make better use of the media to promote its message that our well-being in the future depends on how we look after our built and natural inheritance.\nAt the end of it all, what is the one project you would want to have stopped, contained, or achieved?\nOne project I really believe is a mistake, which I wish could be undone, is the Zaha Hadid Tower. The building was designed by a \u2018great\u2019 architectural firm \u2013 Zaha Hadid was already dead when it was designed. The PA even reduced its planning gain fees because of the additional \u2018costs\u2019 to the developer, given his engagement of a top firm.\nThis, therefore, seems to inhibit us from saying that it is a really ugly building, out of scale with its surroundings, and crushing, in the ugliest way possible, an iconic historic building, Mercury House, which the PA believes is being preserved for posterity!\nIs there any way that some of the damage already done can be undone? Can ugly architecture be torn down? Or have we reached a point of no return?\nOther countries have shown that it is possible to undo damage caused by building mistakes. Whether or not this could be done in Malta depends on how strongly future governments would wish to take it through.\nI think that, in some areas, this will be inevitable. We have a limited land area and, therefore, we cannot afford under-utilised or badly utilised land. By this, I do not mean land where the density of habitation is low but areas where the quality of life is poor, and poor because of the urban environment. Fragmented ownership issues obviously make this process complex and fraught with difficulties.\nNevertheless, I cannot accept that there is any area in Malta that is beyond redemption.\nHowever, we must act now to preserve what has not yet been ruined. It is necessary to radically change our collective approach. Instead of paying lip service to the concept of sustainability, we must really ensure that what we build today is a worthwhile legacy for our children.\nThis requires, in the words of Fiona Reynolds, an almighty \u201cFight for Beauty\u201d. I believe that one first step ought to be to give the voice of civil society, and NGOs such as ours, a strength enshrined within the Constitution, for matters relating to the protection and promotion of the built, cultural and natural heritage.

And our dedication to equality for all our citizens, which is why we have introduced gay marriage, given our 16-year-olds the right to vote, plus free childcare for women wanting to return to work.\nBy joining the EU, Malta gained access to its internal market \u2013 a market of over 500 million people. People who are free to study and work in Malta, like many Maltese have done in other Member States. This has given many of us invaluable work experience, and our students the chance to learn about other cultures through programmes like ERASMUS, making friends for life from all over the EU.\nWe also benefit from trade deals with countries like Japan, which we would not be able to enjoy outside of the EU. And EU funding: Malta has one of the highest project selection rates in Europe. Projects that are benefitting the whole population, from improving our roads and infrastructure, to the restoration of our historic buildings.\nHowever, more can always be done to communicate the benefits of membership to combat the rise in extreme views and another Member State opting for a Brexit-style EU exit. More especially needs to be done to address the current migration situation, from tackling its root causes to devising a fairer system of distribution amongst all Member States.\u201d\n\u2018A success story, but expected more support over migration\u2019\n\nLawrence GonziFormer Prime Minister and Nationalist Party leader\n\u201cMalta\u2019s accession to the European Union and our subsequent decision to join the eurozone have both proved to be a success story in all aspects. The crucial test was faced and overcome during the 2007-2013 financial crisis when Malta outperformed some other EU and non-EU States economically, financially and socially.\nOur accession has seen unprecedented investment in services, manufacturing, infrastructure, environment, heritage and education \u2013 all of which continues to generate results to this very day.\nNotwithstanding our disadvantages as the smallest Member State, our size and our location were leveraged thanks to our integration in the internal market and, of course, the Mediterranean dimension we bring to the table.\nEddie Fenech Adami speaking in Athens after signing Malta\u2019s EU Accession Treaty in April 2003.\nIn the meantime, our younger generations (today 15 years older) have enjoyed new and exciting opportunities in European universities, European business and European institutions, all of which feeds into our national realities every single day.\nThis did not happen by chance or because we were lucky. It happened thanks to a lot of hard work and most importantly thanks to our reputation as a vibrant, young and honest democracy.\nThere are, of course, areas where some of us expected more from our membership. I personally expected more support and understanding when Malta faced a major European migration crisis \u2013 much larger than what we are facing today. This was not always a failure of the European Commission and its institutions.\nThe Commission, the European Parliament and most of the other crucial agencies did indeed provide some support. But some other Prime Ministers sitting around the European Council table decided that their national political realities were more important than the value of solidarity among European peoples \u2013 an issue that continues to disappoint everyone to this very day and that will undoubtedly play a crucial role in the forthcoming European Parliament elections.\u201d\n\u2018The single most important event, but there have been let-downs\u2019\n\nSimon BusuttilFormer Nationalist Party leader\n\u201cJust last week we learnt from a Eurobarometer survey that just 12 per cent of Maltese would vote to leave the EU.\nThis is proof, if any was needed, that EU membership has changed our country for the better and laid the foundations for the prosperity that we enjoy today. Our prosperity did not come from thin air. It came from EU membership.\u00a0\nThe gains of accession have been so substantial that they beg the question of why we had to endure more than 10 years of political bickering over whether we should join.\u00a0\nThe daily lives of countless people have changed since 2004 as a result of membership.\u00a0\nToday, thousands of people work in a sector that did not even exist before accession. Others work abroad because EU membership gave us a right to do so. Consumers benefit from internet-shopping, mobile-telephony and low-cost travel as a result of EU laws. Society benefits from infrastructure built with EU money.\u00a0\nYou can go on and on.\u00a0\nBut most importantly, membership gave us EU citizenship and we now have citizenship rights in a continent of half a billion, rather than just in a country of half a million.\u00a0EU citizenship is truly priceless.\u00a0\nThere have also been let-downs and I expected more help from the EU on immigration and the scandalous sale-of-citizenship scheme. Most regrettably, I expected the EU to be quicker and stronger in helping us fight the corruption, the wholesale hijacking of our institutions and the gradual erosion of democracy that we have witnessed in Malta since 2013.\u00a0\nThat said, there is no doubt in my mind that EU membership has been the single most important event in our country since independence and that it has truly changed the course of our history.\u201d\n\u2018Will tourism, financial services, construction and e-gaming share the fate of manufacturing and farming?\u2019\n\nAlfred SantFormer Prime Minister and Labour Party leader\n\u201cThe promise in economic terms, was that EU membership would greatly enhance Malta\u2019s attractiveness as a location for new investment and improve competitiveness among local operators. Transition periods would allow Maltese enterprises to achieve EU standards painlessly, while Maltese consumers would get better quality at cheaper prices.\nMoreover, Malta would acquire significant EU funds. These would pay for infrastructural investments and contain the initial tough adaptations that firms would undergo.\nThe 15 years subsequent to EU membership can be split into two phases. One ran for practically 10 years, while economic growth rates remained low to very low. During the second phase, covering the following five years or so, growth really took off.\nDuring phase 1, promised EU funds were received, sometimes with lags that disrupted project outcomes. They featured prominently in the government budget, fuelling infrastructural projects, and temporary support programmes for sectors like agriculture.\nYet, the government\u2019s budgetary performance constantly risked breaching EU rules that cover public debt and financial deficits of Member States.\nArguably, this became more pronounced when eventually EU funds were limited to project allocations, that excluded grants-in-aid. Meanwhile too, Malta was paying into the EU budget its own membership dues which though rarely mentioned, increased progressively over the years.\nStill, the expected surge in private investment hardly materialised. For an initial three years, financial services performed dully. Similarly tourism.\nBy contrast in phase 2, post-2013, economic activity surged to unprecedented growth rates that still prevail. The shift was effected because Maltese economic policy stopped only emphasising the need to satisfy the EU\u2019s budgetary strictures and went beyond them to stimulate foreign investment, especially in services.\nTourism, financial, maritime and freeport services, construction, e-gaming have become the name of the game. Ironically, up to now these sectors are subject to minimal EU regulation, which is bound to change.\u00a0 Will they then share the fate of manufacturing and farming?\u201d\n\u2018Malta\u2019s EU and eurozone membership provides safeguards to investors\u2019\n\nLawrence ZammitEconomist and chairman of Misco\n\u201cMalta has made significant gains since joining the European Union in 2004. I strongly believe that we have managed to exploit all the benefits that were envisaged at the time we applied for membership and during the negotiations phase. One way of looking at this is by seeking to understand how our country would have performed economically, socially and politically had we not joined the European Union in 2004 and the eurozone in 2008. It is easy to mention the funds that Malta has benefitted from as a result of joining the EU.\nHowever we should also mention other things. We form an integral part of the European project, to which Maltese have generally aspired. The fact that Malta is a member of the EU and the eurozone provides safeguards to foreign investors, on which our economy depends significantly. The seeds of the economic growth we enjoy today were sown when we took the decision to join the European Union.\nOur integration into Europe has also brought about a greater realisation of the principles of freedom that we cherish. Our EU membership has also made our society more willing to embrace diversity. It has strengthened our democracy.\nHas the EU fallen short of Malta\u2019s needs? I do not really think so. We need to appreciate that there are certain issues that we need to resolve and we cannot expect the EU to resolve them for us. It is important to note that at the time of the EU referendum 54 per cent had voted in favour of EU membership. Today surveys show that around 75 per cent of the population in Malta believe that the country will be worse off outside the EU.\u201d\n\u2018Security a major concern\u2019\n\nMandy FalzonHead of Malta-EU Steering and Action Committee (MEUSAC)\n\u201cOverall, I think Malta\u2019s accession to the EU had a positive impact on Malta\u2019s economy, the quality of life of Maltese citizens and the opportunities brought about by the single market, particularly the freedom of movement of goods, services, people and capital.\nThe EU has contributed towards improving the quality standards of the food we consume, the toys our children play with, the possibility to study and work in other EU Member States and the major investment carried out on Malta\u2019s infrastructure and human capital as a result of EU funding.\nMaltese citizens have consistently shown they are in favour of EU membership, however security remains a major concern for them. The EU has often been rebuked by citizens for failing to find a common European response to this problem.\u00a0\nAnother issue is the one-size-fits-all approach which, at times, is not always appropriate for a Union of 500 million citizens. As the smallest EU Member State, Malta has advocated frequently on the need to have policies that take into account the different characteristics and size of different EU Member States particularly for certain sectors of the economy such as agriculture.\nMEUSAC will continue to act as a bridge between the citizens and the EU to ensure that EU membership remains a success story.\u201d\n\u2018EU has changed our mindset\u2019\n\nSimon De CesarePresident, Malta Business Bureau\n\u201cMalta has gained substantially from EU membership. The most visible is the investment in capital projects that were accomplished thanks to the co-financing from the EU budget, whereby EU cohesion funds contributed heavily among others towards upgrading the road infrastructure, new health and education facilities, and renovating our cultural heritage.\nThis enabled industry and commerce to flourish, our tourism product became more attractive, and the wellbeing of citizens improved. But EU membership has enabled much more than what meets the eye. It consolidated Malta on the map of the developed world; it opened internationalisation prospects to our businesses with market access to third countries worldwide; and it improved the general standard of living.\nMost of all and more importantly, I believe the EU has changed the mindset of the Maltese, who are now a people that is more open and ambitious to travel, study, live and do business abroad.\nOn the other hand, the EU has undoubtedly let Malta down on the issue of migration. It is true that this is mostly due to the lack of solidarity of several Member States, but ultimately it remains an EU failure. Facing a reality of ageing population in Europe and an immediate skills crisis, one would have expected that the EU is able to turn the migration challenge into an opportunity, primarily through fair burden-sharing, and secondly, with a strong vision of integrating migrants in the labour market, as well as their second generation in formal education and training.\nThis way, Europe would increase productivity, and also spreads the weight of social contributions on a larger pool of people, while relieving stress from our current systems that are not sustainable in the long term.\u201d", "comment_count": 11, "id": 2864}, {"keywords": "", "author": "Claire Caruana", "article_body": "The government has committed to giving the nurses\u2019 union Mount Carmel Hospital renovation time frames by next week, Tiems of Malta has learnt.\nMalta Union of Midwives and Nurses (MUMN) president Paul Pace said that the nurses were promised by the Health Ministry that the time frames would be supplied by \u201cnext week\u201d.\nOn Wednesday, the newspaper reported that the union had threatened the government with industrial action if it did not provide time frames that outline the work planned for the hospital.\nIn comments to the newspaper following the meeting, Mr Pace confirmed that the ministry had indeed agreed to provide the union with the timeframes.

It also needed to be echoed in other sectors, such as in sports.\nDr Muscat encouraged a \"winner's attitude\", saying people to be disciplined to achieve their goals. \"We need a winner's attitude because we are a country of winners,\" he said.\nAffordable housing initiatives\nAffordable housing has become an issue, with those who did not own property struggling to rent or buy, the Prime Minister acknowledged.\nA project giving a leg up to those who truly could not afford proper housing, and could help provide another layer of stability and protection to those who need it.\n\"We want to help people who need to work two jobs to make ends meet,\" Dr Muscat said. \"We need to give positive measures so those who feel left behind can be given a boost\", he added.\nThe government wanted to do this because it never forgot its roots and always thought of those that needed help.\n'Who is more competent: Joseph or Delia?'\nDr Muscat said he did not speak about the upcoming May elections during his speech, despite the annual general conference marking the start of the Labour party European Parliament and local council campaign.\nThis was because he did not believe in simply speaking about matters during election campaigns, only to later forget them. \"Elections come and go. Politicians come and go,\" he said.\nThe Prime Minister ended his speech by encouraging people to make a choice, between which of the two party leaders is more competent and who delivers.\n\"Who is [the person] you know where you stand with? Joseph or Delia,\" he asked.\n\"Who can offer solutions: Joseph or Delia?

In a day of legal drama, the urgent lawsuit reached the constitutional court at 12.30pm on Thursday, which led to Mr Justice Mark Chetcuti giving the Prime Minister 24 hours to reply and appointing an urgent hearing for Monday morning.\nNinety minutes later another urgent application requested a stay of the appointments but this was rejected by the judge on the basis that the \u201cprejudice [caused by the appointments] is not irremediable\u201d.\nThis allowed the appointments to go ahead an hour later at the Palace in Valletta just down the road from the law courts.\u00a0\u00a0\nBut according to Prof. Aquilina, \u201cPrudence should have dictated that the judicial appointments should not have been rushed through bearing in mind that there were a number of factors which militated against such appointments.\u201d\nAside from the constitutional challenge itself, he cites various factors: failure to revamp the judicial selection mechanism as recommended by the Venice Commission and Bonello Commission; the fact that the current mechanism has been deemed flawed within the context of Strasbourg case law and expert reports; and the cascade of other recent reports \u201cin the same vein as the Venice Commission report that there is a serious rule of law problem in Malta\u201d.\nYet another factor is that the Justice Minister moved first readings of bills inspired by aspects of the Venice Commission report without publishing the bills in the Government Gazette.\n\u201cBy its inaction, the Maltese government continues to defy these international and European human rights instruments, the case law of the European Court of Human Rights as well as the various bodies which are, and will continue, to pen negative reports,\u201d Prof. Aquilina said.\n\u201cMalta is currently being disgraced all over the world through such governmental conduct, reaping serious reputational harm to the country.\u201d\nThe dean sat on the Bonello Commission in 2013, which advised the government on comprehensive reform of the justice system, including judicial appointments. But he has since become a strident critic of the government for ignoring its own commissioned report and instead ushering amendments on judicial appointments in 2016 which he says are in breach of human rights.\nHe blames the government for the current fix, saying it has \u201cacted, and continues to act, in bad faith\u201d.\nHe is also critical of the judge\u2019s decision to reject the request for a stay of last Thursday\u2019s judicial appointments. He points out that although he \u201cunderstands\u201d that the court \u201cformulated\u201d its decision on a specific article in law, 873(3) of the COCP, \u201cthe issue here was not of a purely civil law nature but relates to a more fundamental matter \u2013 a constitutional human rights law issue\u201d.\n\u201cIf the judicial appointments were to take place, as they have now done, that would have been another breach of Article 39 of the Constitution and Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights,\u201d he elaborates. \u201cI say \u2018would have been\u2019 not \u2018could have been\u2019 because there is case law of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) to this effect.\n\u201cThe irremediable harm,\u201d he adds, referring to the judge\u2019s take that the appointments do not constitute \u2018irremediable\u2019 prejudice, \u201clies in the fact that the Constitution is being breached, the European Convention on Human Rights is being breached, and any person who has a pending court case before a judge or magistrate can attack the validity of the decree or decision or judgment on the basis that the appointment made by the government runs counter to the case law of the ECtHR in relation to the impartiality of a judge or magistrate. For the Strasbourg Court all the judiciary appointed since 2013 (and before) lack impartiality.\u201d\nAlthough the judiciary has long been appointed at the choice and discretion of the Prime Minister, the recent evolutions of case law in the ECtHR as well as publication of the Bonello Commission report in 2013, and more significantly the Venice Commission report last December, have all provided points of departure to implement changes to the mechanism of judicial appointments.\nThe significance of Venice Commission reports is that they are often cited in judgments of the ECtHR. And Repubblika\u2019s lawyers Simon Busuttil and Jason Azzopardi are arguing that the Venice Commission report created a point of reference prior to the latest appointments \u2013 an argument that has traction in constitutional level courts, according to analysts.\nA European expert in human rights issues who has worked at the ECtHR told The Sunday Times of Malta on condition of anonymity that he cannot foresee the Reppublika constitutional suit progressing directly to the ECtHR because of \u201cprocedural issues\u201d. He added: \u201cBut the case of judicial appointments being in breach of the right to fair trial is a valid legal argument in a domestic constitutional court, where this is playing out.\u201d\nPointing out that any appointments since 2013 do not comply with Strasbourg case law, Prof. Aquilina adds that there is \u201cno guarantee\u201d that the constitutional court will follow ECtHR judgments on the matter. The constitutional court does not have a good track record, he says: nine out of 10 of constitutional court cases taken to the ECtHR are overturned on human rights violations.\n\u201cThe government\u2019s lawyer, the Attorney General, will typically raise all possible conceivable dilatory pleas to delay and cause procrastination on a decision being taken in this case. The courts may embrace the idea of deciding the case on a procedural point so that the substantive points are never decided as they would end up opening a pandora\u2019s box.\nFor the Strasbourg Court all the judiciary appointed since 2013 lack impartiality\n\u201cThe outcome would be that the government wins the case and injustice is meted out. It would have to be the ECtHR to eventually be called upon to make things right. By that time the only solution left would be to replace all the judiciary and to rewrite the constitutional provisions on judicial appointment.\u201d\nWill the appointees be suspended?\u00a0\nIn the context of the constitutional court considering a request to nullify last Thursday\u2019s appointments, an immediate complication is whether the appointees shall serve in the interim.\nA senior source in the legal system who did not wish to be named said: \u201cIf the Chief Justice allows them to serve, that would amount to putting pressure on the constitutional court to decide to allow the appointments to stay.\u201d\nAsked to comment on this point, and whether he would be withholding any work to the new appointees until the constitutional case decides on the matter, the Chief Justice said that in view of \u201cpending lawsuit I cannot answer your question\u201d.\nThe president of the Chamber of Commerce, Louis de Gabriele, also declined to comment on these questions for the same reason.\nProf. Aquilina said that \u201cthe Chief Justice has no right to suspend them for it is not the fault of the appointees if the government has decided to rush through their appointments\u201d. He added that \u201conce appointed they [the appointees] have to carry out the duties of office\u201d.\nMr Justice Chetcuti\u2019s decision not to put a stay on the appointments last Thursday, on the rationale that the \u201cprejudice\u201d from the appointments is not \u201cirremediable\u201d, implies that the court may decide to suspend or nullify the appointments.\nThe lawsuit itself requests interim measures, primary among them the possible suspension of the appointments until final judgment is delivered.\n\nThe constitutional lawsuit in brief\nThe unprecedented constitutional suit filed by Repubblika posits that the judicial appointments are in breach of right-to-fair-trial provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights, right to effective remedy and fair trial of the EU\u2019s fundamental charter of rights, as well as the Maltese Constitution \u2013 independence and impartiality of courts, and the first article, \u201crespect for the fundamental rights and freedoms of the individual\u201d. Another point is that the appointments additionally flout the Treaty of the European Union.\nThe application quotes extensively from last December\u2019s report on Malta by the Venice Commission \u2013 this is the point of departure for the lawsuit, and its strongest anchor \u2013 and then additionally invokes the EU\u2019s treaty and charter of fundamental rights of EU citizens.\nMuch is made on the precedent set by the European Court of Justice which imposed interim measures on Poland in a case also involving the judiciary, an exposition that raises the possibility that this may be a viable waypoint for Reppublika\u2019s case.\nIn its response, the government draws the battle lines by attacking the lawsuit on various technical and procedural points, including the argument \u2013 dismissed in the past by the ECtHR \u2013 that the parties have no direct juridical claim to breaches of the right to fair hearing. An argument is also put forward that the Venice Commission makes recommendations in the context of an \u2018opinion\u2019, and that these are non-binding.\nThe applicants, the Justice Minister argues, are \u201cabsurd\u201d in their requests, which would amount to \u201cparalysing the courts and certainly this is not in the better interest of the administration of justice\u201d.\nThe lawsuit\u2019s confluence of requests seems designed to annul last Thursday\u2019s judicial appointments and ensure that any appointments for the duration of the case, as well as all future appointments, can only be made under a new system devised on the recommendations of the Venice Commission.", "comment_count": 130, "id": 2871}, {"keywords": "", "author": "Vanessa Macdonald", "article_body": "Changing the culture with regards to construction safety was as important as changing the legislation, according to Catherine Halpin, the CEO of Quad Business Towers.\n\u201cThere is definitely no legislation and no health and safety practice that could not be improved in some way.

Early school leavers are those aged between 18 and 24 with, at most, lower secondary education and who are not in further education or training.

The Egrant inquiry started a few weeks before the two Schembri inquiries.\nExpertise initially directed towards Egrant probe\nA source familiar with the work involved said all three inquiries are dependent to varying extents on the cooperation of foreign jurisdictions.\nRequests by the courts for information from foreign jurisdictions are known to take considerable lengths of time, depending on the country involved.\nThe source said a lot of the court expertise being used for the Schembri inquiries was initially tied up in the complex evidence-gathering processes needed for the Egrant probe.\nMr Justice Aaron Bugeja said in the published conclusions for the Egrant inquiry that evidence relevant to the two other probes was obtained during his own inquiry.\nOf the two inquiries, the one being led by Josette Demicoli looks to be the more complex.\nThe money flows being traced in that inquiry involve accounts in Gibraltar and Switzerland, as well as in local financial institutions, including MFSP (since renamed as Zenith Finance), Pilatus Bank, Sparkasse Bank and HSBC.\nIt is likely that this inquiry also requires cooperation from the British Virgin Islands, which holds information about Lester Holdings, the company used by Mr Hillman to receive the payments in US dollars and euros from the Prime Minister\u2019s chief of staff between 2010 and 2015.\nMr Hillman oversaw the award of a lucrative multi-million euro contract for Mr Schembri\u2019s company Kasco to supply printing equipment to Progress Press, Allied Group\u2019s printing arm.\nOn paper, the inquiry being led by Magistrate Galea Sciberras looks the simpler of the two in terms of evidence gathering, as the \u20ac100,000 payment between Mr Tonna and Mr Schembri was transferred locally via Pilatus Bank.\nHowever, information would also be needed from the British Virgin Islands, where the company used by Mr Tonna to send the two \u20ac50,000 payments was based.\nSuspicions about the purpose of these transactions were raised after the FIAU found \u20ac166,000 were sent to Mr Tonna\u2019s Pilatus account by three Russian passport buyers.\nPart of those funds were then transferred on to Mr Schembri for what the men described as a loan repayment for money lent to Mr Tonna in 2012 to help him during his separation proceedings.\nThe Tonnas\u2019 separation deed shows the couple jointly bought a \u017bejtun field 15 days after the date of the agreement for the \u20ac100,000 \u201cloan\u201d to help him with the separation.\nHow does this contrast with Egrant?\nAaron Bugeja was tasked with establishing whether the shell company Egrant was owned by Prime Minister Joseph Muscat\u2019s wife Michelle.\nThe inquiry heard the testimony of 477 witnesses, requested information or assistance from authorities in five countries \u2013 Panama, Belgium, Germany, US and the UAE\u00a0 \u2013 and engaged various IT experts and firms.\nThese included foreign firms, such as UK-based firms Ansec IA Ltd, Harbinson Forensics and Key Forensic Services, as well as local IT experts Godwin Caruana and inspector Timothy Zammit.\nIn the UAE\u2019s case, which also happens to be where the mystery company 17 Black is domiciled, no official cooperation was forthcoming.\nThe Egrant inquiry also obtained assurances from Oracle Flexcube banking software experts that information on Pilatus Bank servers could be relied upon \u201cfrom its first day of operation\u201d.\nWill we know when the inquiries are concluded?\nThere is no procedure or obligation for a magistrate to inform the public that an inquiry has been concluded.\nIt is also up to the discretion of the Attorney General whether to publish the inquiry details or not after a formal request is made.
