The contract was for five weeks, which was extended by two weeks. The buyers then requested an extension of a further two weeks to allow them time for the bank to confirm whether or not they had been granted a loan. The seller refused.\nNotary Grech Trapani had assisted the Donlevys in the process leading to the promise of sale agreement. When they refused to extend the agreement, they informed him.\nRuby Donlevy claimed that Notary Grech Trapani told her that the promise of sale agreement was now void and that she could put the property back on the market, without informing notary Abela. He even suggested a new potential buyer \u2013 Ro\u2019Anna Borg. A promise of sale agreement was eventually also signed with Ms Borg. The contract was signed before notary Grech Trapani.\nBoth promise of sale agreements had been duly registered.\nThe Donlevys were then informed by notary Abela and their estate agent that the first promise of sale agreement was still valid at law and the Micallefs still wanted to buy the property.\nEventually the parties to both promise of sale agreements filed for warrants of prohibitory injunction to stop the transfer of the property. Neither was prepared to surrender his contract.\nThe Donlevys had talks with both, in search of a solution and eventually compensation of \u20ac80,000 was paid to the Micallefs. \u20ac10,000 were paid to the Ro\u2019Anna Borg to cover her legal costs. She eventually bought the property.\u00a0 Notary Grech Trapani published the sale contract. \u00a0\nDr Grech Trapani denied ever having been granted any mandate by the Donlevys. He insisted that it was Ruby Donlevy who had informed him that the promise of sale agreement with the Micallefs had fallen through and she therefore wished to put the property back on the market. Therefore, he said, it was she who had misinformed him. He held the Ruby and Brian Donlevy responsible for professional defamation.\nIn his testimony notary Grech Trapani said the first promise of sale was no longer valid owing to procedural issues. Furthermore, the Donlevys had had several courses of action open to them instead of having resorted to the compensation of \u20ac80,000. He could not understand how the Donlevys had asked him to eventually publish the contract of sale to Ro\u2019anna Borg when they intended to sue him for alleged negligence.\nMr Justice Lawrence Mintoff said the documents and e-mails produced in court showed that notary Grech Trapani was involved in all stages of the sale of the property, even before the first promise of sale agreement was signed.\nHe was also present when that first promise of sale agreement was signed before Notary Abela and therefore should have been well aware of its terms. He also played a crucial role in the conclusion of talks with the eventual buyer Ro\u2019anna Borg.\nMs Borg\u2019s testimony showed that it was notary Grech Trapani who had told her that the first promise of sale agreement was void. The evidence showed that such advice had been given without the necessary verification and without the notary having even read the promise of sale agreement of March 8, 2013.\nThe court said that even if the Donlevys had claimed that the first promise of sale agreement was no longer valid, notary Grech Trapani had a professional duty to ascertain himself of the facts and not just take their word and signing the second promise of sale.

I have only read the decree and, of course, I am not party or privy as to why, 26 months after the arraignment, the bill of indictment has not yet been filed in the Criminal Court against the person in question (nor do I understand the reference to the 30-month term in the decree).\n\u201cIf a case is difficult or complex, special resources must be assigned to ensure that the compilation of evidence is conducted efficiently and effectively.\n\u201cThere is, however, a positive point in that decree: the reference to electronic monitoring or tagging within the criminal justice system. This could, indeed, help reduce the disproportionate number of people in prison awaiting trial. The Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe has even adopted, in 2014, a detailed recommendation on this matter,\u201d he replies.\nThe Criminal Code provides for two sets of time limits after which the court must grant the accused bail.\nChief Justice Emeritus Vincent De Gaetano\nArticle 575, which was substantially amended in 1989 following a Constitutional Court judgment in the Lawrence Pullicino case, had struck down the blanket prohibition on bail in the case of very serious offences. It is intended to cater for the peculiarities of the Maltese legal system where a trial by jury usually follows a lengthy judicial inquiry, referred to in Maltese as kumpilazzjoni and which the English-speaking media usually term as \u2018compilation of evidence\u2019. (In 1993, Mr Pullicino was sentenced to 15 years in prison after being found guilty of complicity in causing grievous bodily harm followed by death to a person while under police interrogation at the headquarters in 1980. At the time, he was commissioner of police.)\nThe first set of terms \u2013 12 months, 16 months or 20 months, depending on the gravity of the offence a person is charged with \u2013 starts running on arraignment.\nIf by the time this term expires the Attorney General has either not filed the bill of indictment in the Criminal Court or has not sent the case to be tried by the Court of Magistrates (as a court of criminal judicature as opposed to a court of criminal in-quiry), then the court must grant bail.\nThe other set of terms \u2013 four, eight, 12, 24 or 30 months, again depending on the punishment the crime attracts \u2013 applies either when no compilation of evidence has taken place and, therefore, the case is technically a summary one, or there has been a compilation of evidence and although the Attorney General sent the case to the Magistrates\u2019 Court or\u00a0 filed the bill of indictment in the Criminal Court,\u00a0 there is as yet no final judgment. Here, too, bail must be granted according to the Criminal Code.\nTrial must be conducted within a reasonable time\nDoes not this amount to merely extending the time one can be held in preventive custody without bail being granted?\n\u201cYou cannot look at this simply numerically,\u201d Dr De Gaetano hastens to reply.\nHe points out that the underlying assumption is that a trial, whether a person is on bail or not, must be conducted within a reasonable time. Unless the prosecution can show there are \u201crelevant and sufficient reasons\u201d for not granting bail, then bail must be granted.\nThe law itself mentions some of the circumstances to be taken into consideration when deciding against bail: the seriousness of the offence, the character of the accused, the possibility of absconding or of surreptitiously leaving Malta, the possibility of interfering or tampering with witnesses or with the course of justice.\nMoreover, if bail is denied and a person is kept in custody awaiting trial, Article 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights has been held to require that the authorities display \u201cspecial diligence\u201d in the conduct of the proceedings, the former chief justice notes.\nThe reasonable time and special diligence requirements are not intended solely for the benefit of the accused but are also in the interest of society in general and of the victims of crime. The Strasbourg Court had declared in a case against France in October 1989 that the reasonable time guarantee in Article 6 of the Convention \u201cunderlines the importance of rendering justice without delays, which might jeopardise its effectiveness and credibility\u201d.\nSome could argue that a complex or difficult case may necessitate the terms linked to bail to be suspended.\nHowever, Dr De Gaetano points out that the terms can only be suspended \u201cin the very limited instances\u201d mentioned in the Criminal Code, such as when a matter is referred to a court having constitutional jurisdiction, when letters rogatory are sent abroad or when the accused himself asks for an adjournment.\n\u201cThe complexity or difficulty of a case does not dispense the authorities from the \u2018special diligence\u2019 requirement when a person is detained without bail,\u201d he remarks.\nDifficult and complex cases, Dr De Gaetano continues, require special resources, structures and proceedings to enable the State to process them within a reasonable time.\n\u201cIn other words, they cannot be left to be dealt with on the same conveyor belt as ordinary cases.\u201d\nHe notes that the compilation stage and subsequent proceedings before either the Court of Magistrates as a court of criminal judicature or before the Criminal Court (trial by jury) are, for the purpose of the Strasbourg case law, regarded as one level of jurisdiction, the second level being proceedings before the Court of Criminal Appeal. Malta has no third level, such as supreme court or cassation appeals, as in other jurisdictions.\n\u201cAs a rule of thumb, and in line with the Strasbourg case law, criminal proceedings lasting between three and four years at one level of jurisdiction and for more than four years at two levels of jurisdiction are potentially capable of raising reasonable time issues under Article 6 of the European convention,\u201d he cautions.", "comment_count": 1, "id": 745}, {"keywords": "", "author": "", "article_body": "A 37-year-old construction worker was seriously injured in a fall at a construction site early on Wednesday.\nThe police said the worker fell from a height in Tower Street, Msida, at about 7.30am.\nThe man was rescued by personnel from the Civil Protection Department and rushed to hospital.\u00a0", "comment_count": 2, "id": 746}, {"keywords": "", "author": "Ramona Depares", "article_body": "Few Norwegians know much about Malta, except that it usually attracts zero points in the Eurovision Song Contest and that its history is connected to the Knights but that is set to change thanks to a concerted drive to export Maltese literature to this Nordic country.\nTranslator Kristina Quintano was the driving force behind a cultural exchange that last week saw author Trevor Zahra attend a number of events at the annual literature festival Translated Days.\nMalta\u2019s participation was made possible thanks to the support of the National Book Council Malta, which was also present for talks with Norwegian publishers about the publication of more Maltese authors in the Nordic country.\n\u201cWe are giving high priority to the export of Maltese literature and there is a significant investment being made in this regard by the National Book Council,\u201d chairman Mark Camilleri said, adding he hoped to build upon this initiative in the near future.\n\u201cAs a council, we believe it is vital for Malta\u2019s authors to be present in foreign markets.

But insight provided by the bank\u2019s chief economist, Aaron Grech, shows a much more nuanced situation, with some trends, such as tourism, playing an as-yet underestimated role.\nDr Grech used statistical data to break down this important sector, isolating those who rent under the pre-1995 controlled rents, those Maltese who rent from the market at commercial rents, the impact on foreign workers and the demand driven by tourists seeking private accommodation.\nMany protected by controlled rents\nSurveys by the National Statistics Office show that a fifth of the Maltese rent and the rest are home owners.\nHowever, of those, the great majority rent under the old regime, with only three to four per cent of the 200,000 or so households in Malta subject to commercial rents.\nThe NSO also checks how much people spend on housing (including electricity, for example) compared to their income, with 40 per cent being the maximum threshold considered sustainable from a risk-of-poverty point of view.\nVery few people who are in controlled rental properties would reach that level, Dr Grech confirmed.\nThe percentage spent on housing by those who rent from the market has increased slightly, the data shows. However, he cautioned that the numbers of people affected are small.\nOf course, the situation would need to be looked at quite differently if pre-1995 contracts were abandoned as a result of judgments by the European Court of Human Rights, which found them to be unfair. In a worst-case scenario, were the contracts to be struck down without any buffer, this would result in tens of thousands who would have to switch to commercial rents.\nWould they be able to afford them? As Dr Grech said, that is another story, and one for which little data is available.\nMaltese still afford own home\nWhat about those Maltese who aspire to own their own home? Certainly, current home owners are in a very positive position at the moment, given low interest rates. And Dr Grech stressed that official statistics show the proportion of Maltese who are becoming home owners is going up, despite the increase in property prices.\nHowever, people might be getting squeezed out of the type of property they would have aspired to in the past.\nThree to four per cent of the 200,000 or so households in Malta are subject to commercial rents\n\u201cWhereas in the past, most of the stock was houses, now most of the new units are flats. So you could argue that people are having to shift to different types of accommodation. That said, it is difficult to see if that implies a lower quality of housing as some of the apartments are very high standard,\u201d Dr Grech explained.\nThe Central Bank does not dismiss these thwarted expectations, with an increasing body of literature in Europe showing that this is what feeds into populism.\n\u201cIn Malta, it is still considered to be a downgrade to go to a flat, especially if your parents had lived in a house, which makes you bitter,\u201d Central Bank Governor Mario Vella remarked.\nFortunately, the outlook in Malta has remained positive overall as people have been able to get a job easily, and jobs that pay better, with Maltese shifting up the employment categories \u2013 leaving gaps in the elementary occupations and those classified as unskilled, which have had to be filled by foreign workers.\n\u201cThis is what might have created this idea of a squeeze in the rental market as before that part of the property market was just for the Maltese,\u201d Dr Grech added.\nIs free market squeezing tenants?\nEven though the numbers of Maltese renting from the market may be low, everyone who ends up being squeezed to pay a higher rent represents a human story. The Central Bank has a new social research unit which is anxious to get beyond numbers.\nHowever, statistics do flag up important trends, such as whether rising rents are pushing people out of their homes.\u00a0\nDr Grech had to shrug helplessly once again: the nature of homelessness makes the collection of data rather sketchy. He said evidence showed that the number of those going to homeless shelters was increasing somewhat, but digging deeper one found it was mainly foreign workers and not locals who simply could not find affordable accommodation.\nAnd the overall number thankfully remained very low when one considered that the island had seen an increase of around 40,000 foreigners in four years, he added.\nVacant stock of properties\nThe price for rental properties depends on the balance between supply and demand. Dr Grech admitted that one thing being overlooked was how the island had managed to accommodate foreigners when the housing stock was what it was.\n\u201cWe started to build when the demand became obvious but it did take a few years till the new properties came online,\u201d he said.\nWhat saved the island was the stock of vacant properties from the previous boom which helped to accommodate the influx.\n\u201cIn 2005, there were 43,000 completely vacant properties. In 2011, there were 41,000. So the stock was already being used up before the influx,\u201d he explained.\nThe tourist population is growing \u2013 with a huge increase in those using private accommodation. Photo: Chris Sant Fournier\nIs tourist demand overlooked?\nHowever, to say that demand for rental property is only coming from foreign workers and residents ignores one other important reality: tourism.\nThe tourist population is growing \u2013 with a huge increase, even relatively speaking, in those using private accommodation.\nLast year, of the 2.6 million arrivals, 0.3 million went into accommodation that was not rented, either staying with friends or in their own property, and a further 0.6 million were in short-term rentals.\n\u201cThat means one million people in a year who are not staying in hotels \u2013 representing eight million nights. This works out to having the equivalent of 150,000 more people on the island each and every day,\u201d he said.\nIf tourists continue to shift to private accommodation then demand for property will continue to grow\n\u201cIf this double-digit growth continues \u2013 and they continue to shift to private accommodation \u2013 then demand for property will continue to grow.\n\u201cWe have gone from 1.5 million arrivals to 2.5 million in five years, whereas it had taken us 20 years before that to increase by a million,\u201d he pointed out.\nLong-term demand\nTourism may continue to grow but what about foreign workers once the economy slows down? Dr Grech shook his head in dismay at the misleading assumptions being made: \u201cWe would only need fewer workers if the economy started to decline. No one is arguing that the economy will decline, only that it will slow down to two to three per cent [growth].\n\u201cThe Maltese population is what it is and will not grow. We are an aging population and the female participation rate has caught up (although we will soon face a caring crisis \u2013 as we cannot assume that the government will continue to create places for people to go into institutional care). If we are going to grow \u2013 even by one to two per cent \u2013 we still need them,\u201d he stressed.\nTemporary workers, different needs\nWorkers who stay here for a few years clearly have different needs to those who come here for a project. There was an uproar last week over whether Turkish workers coming to Malta for a construction project should be housed in pre-fabricated units.\nPrime Minister Joseph Muscat has said that they should definitely \u201cnot be housed in tents\u201d but the Malta Chamber of Commerce, Enterprise and Industry warned against building to cater for foreign workers, as these properties might be left vacant once the economy slows down.\nHowever, the problem is not only one to contemplate as a long-term issue: from an economic point of view, does it make sense to put them into a housing stock that is already under pressure?\u00a0\nDr Vella interjected that it was quite common, from Europe to the Middle East and beyond, for projects which require shift work to be centred around gated communities set up from scratch and dismantled afterwards. He reassured that this was a pragmatic and efficient solution, and that the lack of familiarity with such solutions may raise the fear that the accommodation was cheap or bad.\n\u201cIt is not,\u201d he said emphatically.\nRenting by numbers:\n\u25aa Four-fifths of the Maltese own their own home, one fifth rent.\n\u25aa Three to four per cent of all households pay commercial rents; majority have controlled rents.\n\u25aa There were 41,000 completely vacant properties in 2011, down from 43,000 in 2005.\n\u25aa Tourists in non-hotel accommodation add 150,000 to the population every day.", "comment_count": 40, "id": 781}, {"keywords": "", "author": "Ivan Camilleri", "article_body": "It is probably one of the most damming investigations carried out by the Office of the Ombudsman and its conclusions have been fiercely resisted by the government.

Some of them filed complaints to the Ombudsman.\nThe pair\u2019s journey of a thousand miles had begun with a single step:\nThe crucial promotion\nIn May 2013, two months after the election of the new government, Brigadier Martin Xuereb, the then AFM Commander, issued a circular announcing two vacant positions, entailing promotions from Major to Lieutenant Colonel.\nIn his testimony to the Ombudsman, Brigadier Xuereb said that despite the fact the two positions had become vacant before the 2013 general election, he had felt the process should wait \u201cas it did not make sense to go through a process which will take us to the eve of the election\u201d.\nAn identical exercise had been carried out in 2011 on the basis of established policy grounded in both written and oral examinations and aimed at limiting, as far as possible, the element of subjectivity. Despite this, the new minister responsible for the army, Manuel Mallia, issued a new policy \u201ctotally sweeping away the written complement of the promotion process carried out in 2011,\u201d according to the Ombudsman.\nCrucially, the new policy lowered the requirements for those applying for promotion when compared to the 2011 exercise.\nNo comfort that the selection was done properly\nFor example, in 2011, only those with 15 years of reckonable army service and at least two years of service as a major could apply. Under the new policy, the latter criterion was lowered to just one year.\n\u201cIf not for the 2013 seniority change, these criteria would have prevented a number of majors from applying, including Major Mark Mallia who three months after become the AFM\u2019s number two,\u201d the Ombudsman says in the report on his investigation.\nThe interviewers\nThe composition of the interviewing board had undergone some drastic changes.\nIn 2011, the Senior Ranks Appointments Advisory Committee, which examined the applicants, was composed mainly of military staff. This time round Brigadier Xuereb, an ex-uffico member, was the only military man on the newly composed board \u2013 Minister Mallia had made an unprecedented departure from protocol by appointing two members of his private secretariat to the committee.\nThese were former Labour TV reporter Ramona Attard and his customer care official Clint Cutajar.\nThe committee was presided over by the ministry\u2019s permanent secretary Kevin Mahoney, who had no previous experience in a promotion exercise of this nature. He was answerable to the minister.\nA total of 24 majors applied for the two vacancies.\nThe result\nAll candidates were interviewed over three sessions held during August 2013. Brigadier Xuereb had prepared a dossier on each candidate to serve as an indication of their experience and credentials. However, the Ombudsman found that the marks awarded to the candidates by the majority non-military members of the committee were very different from those awarded by the only army man, Brigadier Xuereb.\nThe process resulted in the promotion from Major to Lieutenant Colonel of eight of the applicants, when there were meant to have been only two vacant posts.\nThe top four candidates to emerge from the exercise were Jeffrey Curmi, Mark Mallia, Pierre Vassallo and Mark Said.\nThe Ombudsman\u2019s main conclusions\nThe Ombudsman observed that \u201cthere seems to have been more promotions than the vacancies warranted\u201d.\nCrucially, he concluded: \u201cThis investigation does not give this Office the comfort that the selection was done properly.\n\u201cFour of the five members of the SRAAC did not have any military knowledge and two of them were persons of trust who were not cognizant of public service protocol, let alone the specific regulation of the Armed Forces. The indications this Office had is that the process was intended to produce a desired outcome.\u201d\nThe selection process, the Ombudsman said, was conducted in an \u201cunprofessional manner and did not achieve the necessary rigour\u201d.\n\u201cThe selection process was a screen for the choice made. The selection process lacks integrity and has given cause to an injustice toward the other candidates.\n\u201cIt was a process tailor-made to achieve a pre-ordained result. As such it improperly discriminated against the complainants and indeed against all the eligible candidates insofar as they were not allowed to compete on an equal, level playing field with the chosen candidates.\n\u201cThe Ombudsman can at this stage only conclude that the selection process was vitiated and that the complainants and indeed all the eligible candidates suffered an injustice as a result of an act of maladministration\u201d\nIn a letter to the Ombudsman, Home Affairs Minister Michael Farrugia expressed disagreement with the majority of his conclusions but said he would discuss them \u201cat length internally and take them into consideration for future processes\u201d.\nRace to the top\nSeptember 13, 2013: At the end of the \u201cvitiated\u201d promotion exercise, Major Jeffrey Curmi and Major Mark Mallia were both appointed Lieutenant Colonels. This was the first step in a sprint to the pinnacle of the army.\nSeptember 27, 2013: Just 14 days later, the new Lieutenant Colonels, Curmi and Mallia, were given the rank of Colonel by then home affairs minister Manuel Mallia.\nOctober 4, 2013: Through a notification in The Government Gazette, the minister announced that Col. Curmi had been promoted to Deputy Commander of the Armed Forces.\nDecember 20, 2013: Another notification announced the appointment of Col. Curmi to Commander and his promotion to Brigadier \u2013 the highest rank in the Maltese army. On the same day, Colonel Mark Mallia was declared to be the AFM\u2019s Deputy Commander.\nNon-military members of selection committee:\nHome Affairs permanent secretary Kevin Mahoney, chairman.\nMr Mahoney had never sat on a selection board related to the army. When the Permanent Secretary was questioned on this, his answer was that the policy had changed.\nHe said he had no input in the new policy. He had simply received it from the minster and did not feel that it should be questioned. He could not explain what motivated the change.\nWhen asked whether the policy was formulated by the minister himself, the permanent secretary replied that he thought so.\nRamona Attard, One TV reporter and deputy chief of staff at Home Affairs.\nMs Attard, who had no experience whatsoever in military affairs, thought, according to the Ombudsman, that the law imposed the presence of the Minister\u2019s chief of staff (Silvio Scerri) on the selection board, and that she had been appointed in his absence. The Ombudsman said this was not reflected in the law. She admitted she had been appointed by the minister and that Prime Minster Joseph Muscat had also spoken to her.\nOn the assessment of communication skills during the interviews, Ms Attard told the Ombudsman that \u201cthat was her topic\u201d meaning, presumably, that she could assess whether an army officer could communicate properly with those around him.\nClint Cutajar, canvasser and head of customer services at the ministry.\nMr Cutajar told the Ombudsman that he was not sure who had told him to be a member of the board \u2013 it could have been the minister or Mr Scerri.\nWhen asked how he allocated his marks on appearance he replied: \u201cAppearance is his appearance, how he behaves and if he\u2019s clean.\u201d\nThe Ombudsman said: \u201cMr Cutajar was out of his depth and he seemed to realise this. He felt he had to obey the minister\u2019s wishes, reinforced by those of the chief of staff, and sit on the board.\u201d\nGovernment resistance to investigation\nManuel Mallia\nIn December 2013, six majors who had applied for the promotion filed a request for an investigation by the Ombudsman claiming the process was flawed.\nHowever, it took three long years for the investigation to start because the government objected to it, arguing that the Ombudsman had no remit to initiate the probe.\nThe Ombudsman sent letters and held meetings with the minister and the permanent secretary but the government and the army kept ignoring his order to pass on the files related to the promotion exercise.\nThe Ombudsman was forced to file an unprecedented law suit against the government over the matter and the court eventually found in his favour, ordering the government to give him access to the requested files.\nArmy choices: Ombudsman\u2019s choice words\n\u25aa Unprofessional\u25aa A desired outcome\u25aa Lacked integrity\u25aa A screen\u25aa An injustice\u25aa Tailor-made\u25aa Pre-ordained\u25aa Vitiated\u25aa Maladministration", "comment_count": 191, "id": 782}, {"keywords": "", "author": "Ivan Martin", "article_body": "Teachers are getting pushed around and need insurance cover, according to the Union of Professional Educators.\nAddressing a press conference outside the Office of the Prime Minister, union president Graham Sansone said both indemnity insurance, and coverage against injury and loss of earnings were being proposed as requirements.\n\u201cThe teaching profession has changed over the years.

But she also knows that the worst thing would be to give up.\nFrom when you took on the role of DL\u0126 executive president in 2015, how has the situation in Malta changed as regards heritage and the environment? How has your own outlook on the status quo and the future changed?\nThere has been a lot of change in Malta over the past four years, and I have to say both heritage and the environment have suffered greatly. We have only to look around us to see the effects of the building frenzy everywhere. It is not only disfiguring what was a unique architectural landscape but making life rather unbearable, with the consequent effects on health and lifestyle.\nThere is a dichotomy, however, as many public and private projects have greatly improved degraded areas through sensitive and intelligent regeneration and conservation, including Pjazza Tritoni, for example (before the container shops were introduced).\nMy own personal position has not changed at all. In fact I would quote the very same things I said when I first took on the role of DL\u0126 executive president: too much and too fast; not enough planning and long-term vision; ugly is not a necessity and beauty is not a luxury.\nLooking back, has your stint at the helm of DL\u0126 been a fruitless and thankless battle overall, given that a tidal wave of development and demolition has hit Malta?\nYou are right in describing it as a tidal wave, as just as we face one battle there seem to be another three or four looming on the horizon! However, every achievement in saving part of Malta\u2019s incredible patrimony must be deemed as a success, no matter how small. The worst thing that could happen to us is to become complacent, or give up, which is why I cannot bear to hear, when discussing the probable demolition of a degraded building, the argument: \u201cWhat on earth do you want to save?\u201d\nWe must continue speaking out, and in the end, the decision makers will listen. What is very encouraging is that the public has also become engaged, especially when it affects their neighbourhood.\nWhat would you say was the NGO\u2019s biggest achievement during your term of office; and what was its biggest failure?\nI believe one of the biggest achievements during my term of office was when we won the appeal on the Townsquare high-rise development, along with the other appellants: Flimkien g\u0127al Ambjent A\u0127jar, the Sliema local council and the Environment and Resources Authority.\nI felt vindicated that DL\u0126\u2019s insistence that the tower would be seen over the Valletta skyline was legitimate, and in fact, the height has been considerably scaled down in order not to be seen from the other side of Grand Harbour. It was unfortunate that the Mrie\u0127el appeal was not successful.\nAnother first for DL\u0126 was the sentence whereby contempt of court proceedings were initiated over the failure by the Planning Authority to protect St Ignatius Villa from partial demolition. We have also recently been granted the right to appeal the refusal to schedule this building of extremely high historical and architectural importance.\nAnother very big achievement was the coming together of 22 entities to make a declaration outside Parliament on April 18, 2018. We called it Wirtna \u2013 Our Legacy, and we called on the authorities to put a stop to the destruction of Malta\u2019s heritage buildings and cultural landscape, with several tangible suggestions on how to protect it. It is a real satisfaction to know that there are so many entities that share the same concerns and love of our patrimony.\nOf course, there are the 19 historical sites DL\u0126 has restored, which are managed and opened to the public by dedicated teams of volunteers. This, in itself, is an immense achievement, with 90,000 visitors recorded this year, and rising! Our latest project, the White Tower of Armier is at a very advanced stage and will be an interesting educational visitor attraction, with the possibility of overnight accommodation for groups.\nIt is unfortunate that the PA seems to be more engaged in trying to meet developers\u2019 demands than carrying out the role it was created for\nI think what has been achieved through the sheer hard work and dedication of the volunteers on council and at the sites is wonderful. They do everything, from fundraising to organising events; thinking up and co-ordinating the projects.\nAnd the greatest challenge over these years\u2026\nI suppose it is the sheer magnitude and extent of the \u2018watchdog\u2019 role, which is DL\u0126\u2019s mission and which, in today\u2019s scenario, may seem overwhelming. If planning laws and regulations were tighter and more clear-cut, then everybody would have more peace of mind. However, there is so much room for interpretation that, many times, even if a case officer recommends refusal, the vote would be in favour of the application.\nYou seem to be one of the few entities with enough teeth to attempt to resist the ruin of the islands. What about the actual authorities entrusted with this role? Where are they? What should they be doing? And why is any criticism and protest so ineffective?\nBeing a voluntary organisation, we are not beholden to anybody and this gives us the confidence to speak out about what we believe in. The authority entrusted with the role, that is, the Superintendence of Cultural Heritage, we feel needs to be given the necessary resources to carry out its job effectively and should have the last word when it comes to decisions on heritage.\nAlso, it is unfortunate that the PA seems to be more engaged in trying to meet developers\u2019 demands than carrying out the role it was created for; that is, delivering a good planning vision and framework for development to take place, achieving a balance between the new and the old, and sensible land use as opposed to short-sighted speculation.\nOne of the greatest frustrations and paradoxes is that everyone seems to complain about the environment, yet these loud voices would appear to have no power whatsoever and the wanton destruction continues. Do you feel the public does not protest loudly enough and what would it take for these complaints not to fall on deaf ears?\nOn the contrary, the public is becoming very proactive and speaking out. One has only to see the constant discussions on social media; a lot of opinion is being voiced. You are right in saying that protests fall on deaf ears though, and it is a great shame that the authorities do not listen to the people enough.\nLook at the objections to the DB tower and ex-ITS site at Pembroke \u2013 there were over 4,000 objectors to this project. Surely, they should have counted for something?\nI disagree that people do nothing but complain. People are taking the future of their neighbourhoods very seriously and even forming grass-roots groups, and creating forums, where public discussions are taking place. We have seen this with G\u017cira, Pembroke and \u017bejtun residents, and now Xemxija residents too.\nPeople are refusing to accept building development in their locality that will have a negative impact on their health and environment. They demand to be listened to. In the case of Bulebel in \u017bejtun, it worked. Pembroke residents were ignored, but now there is the appeal outcome this week [The appeal decision is now public]. Dialogue is important, and people expect a modicum of transparency and fairness in decisions that affect their life.\u00a0\nDL\u0126 files an average of 10 to 12 objections to PA applications each week. These are restricted to more urgent UCA and ODZ cases and do not even include applications for development zones. It would appear to be completely ignored and rarely are any cases won. Only around 10 per cent of permits objected to get refused. How demoralising is that?\nAgain, the tragedy is there is so much room for interpretation of the policies and regulations. Planning should not be like that. It should be tighter and with no room for ifs and buts. Everybody would be happy to comply.\nThe number of refusals of the permits objected to is, indeed, very low, but I would feel worse if we had not tried. We need to increase our presence at the actual hearings to communicate our reasons better and more directly to the board. However, with our present resources, this has not been possible.\nSince the Data Protection Act was passed, no photos of buildings that are the subject of applications are uploaded and this has become an administrative issue for DL\u0126 because it is now unable to scrutinise and judge if a building is worthy of retention or not. Would you say this is an infringement of our right to know and access information? And what are you doing about it?\nWe have written to the chairman and CEO of the PA about it but we should take it further. We have had to rely on our interpretation of the drawings only. Photographs are so helpful, and it is ridiculous to say they are violating someone\u2019s right to privacy. I believe it is an infringement of the public\u2019s right to access information.\nThe destruction we are witnessing has been described as the tip of the iceberg. What is actually going under the radar and what lies in store?\nThe problem is that there is a lot of money out there, and speculative construction projects are perhaps the best way to invest it. This is creating the current situation, where investors are buying entire rows of houses and large plots of land to do something that will earn them more money. There is no consideration for the needs of the community or the locality, nor of the consequent changes, both physical and social, these projects will bring.\nWe should be looking at what Malta needs rather than how much money will be made, and here the regulator is greatly to blame. Our health is suffering from this excessive construction, and this was one of our resolutions at the AGM last week: to protect well-being and quality of life.\nThe other five were to strengthen protection of cultural and natural heritage at law; to urge the PA to fulfil the role it was created for; to request that best options be sought for a Malta-Gozo permanent link; to protect the coast and foreshore from land reclamation; and for the protection of historic buildings and urban conservation areas through the creation of buffer zones.\nWhat was your parting shot at the AGM?\nAmong other things, I mentioned the recent hoarding at Malta International Airport, which consists of dozens of photos of Maltese doorways. It is so ironic that these very doorways, which are threatened and going down like dominoes every week, are chosen as the image to welcome visitors to our country.\nWe must recognise the value we have in our traditional streetscapes, which are truly unique, and give them the appreciation they deserve. Soon these will be only photos on hoardings and in coffee-table books. We are being incredibly short-sighted in allowing this to happen.\nYou will shortly be passing on the baton to a new president. What is your advice to the person who is stepping into your shoes and what are you expecting from his approach?\nThe new council has been elected and the president will be appointed at our first council meeting. There will be many challenges ahead as the issues of the Gozo tunnel, mega projects, land reclamation and the destruction of more historical buildings and gardens come to the fore.\nI am sure, though, that the new executive president will take this on with the characteristic level-headed yet impassioned approach that has distinguished DL\u0126 since its formation 54 years ago. The team spirit on council will ensure a supportive backing so that the many aims of the organisation will continue.\nDespite all these efforts, where do you see Malta from an environment and heritage point of view for the next generation? What have we already lost? And what can we still stand to gain?\nI think Malta is at a make-or-break point \u2013 we either stop the destruction and degeneration from overdevelopment now or we live to regret it. What we aren\u2019t realising is that what we are destroying, as shown on the photos on the hoarding at the airport, is a valuable asset, which we have the duty to pass on to our children. It is what gives us identity, but instead of being proud of it and protecting it, we prefer to destroy it for immediate profit.\nThe natural environment is not faring any better, with the constant eating away at ODZ and the threat to many pristine agricultural areas and aquifers by more and more development.

However, in August, just before the six-month probationary period was due to expire, she was notified that she was being fired on grounds of non-performance.\nThe fact that such a decision was communicated to her days after she had notified Union Print about her pregnancy left no doubts about the reason for her dismissal, the employee claimed.\nOn its part the company insisted that it had abided by the law which states that in case where there is good and sufficient cause, a pregnant employee can be fired during probation, as long as the grounds for her dismissal are specified. While denying Ms Mifsud Calabr\u00f2\u2019s claims, the company insisted that prior to terminating her employment, she had been warned various times about her poor performance.\nIn its decision the tribunal noted that according to the law, in cases where a pregnant employee sought redress, it was up to the employer to prove that such a decision was not related to pregnancy.\nTo this end, GWU president Victor Carachi testified that the only reason why Union Print sacked the employee was \u201cbased purely on performance and nothing else\u201d.\nAs a matter of fact, during proceedings it emerged that Ms Mifsud Calabr\u00f2 had only sold \u20ac9,500 worth of adverts.

Furthermore, the tribunal heard that apart from the plaintiff, one of her colleagues had also missed the sales target, but the latter was not fired.\nA crucial element in the case was the lack of monthly targets in the employment contract. Such consideration was made by the tribunal in the wake of the fact that in her letter of discharge, Ms Mifsud Calabr\u00f2 was told that the volume of sales reached was just \u201c25 per cent of what is expected as the norm\u201d.\nIt was pointed out that this \u201cnorm\u201d had not been established or quantified by the employer.
