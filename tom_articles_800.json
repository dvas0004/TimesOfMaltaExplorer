Moreover, the committee cited a provision in the General Elections Act on special cases such as co-option.\nAsked whether he subscribed to the Gozo committee\u2019s view, Dr Bonello noted that the Constitution was the law that regulated all laws and, consequently, its provisions had to be respected by all.\u00a0\nThe new member must have the same links with Gozo, constituents and constituencies as the member he is substituting\nThe matter of co-option of a new member of the House of Representatives, he noted, was governed by several constitutional rules, including two in particular.\n\u201cThe first is that Gozo is deemed to be a special region, different from the rest of Malta, and one to which specific constitutional rules are to apply. The Constitution recognises the particular identity and characteristics of Gozo as a separate and different entity from Malta,\u201d he said\nThe second rule was that when the need of co-opting a new MP arose, the new member must be \u201cas nearly as can be of the interests and opinions represented and held by the vacating member\u201d.

The new party won 9.3% of the votes in the 1962 elections and elected four MPs (one of whom, the late Coronato Attard of Gozo, shortly afterwards switched to the Nationalist Party).\nBut Nationalist supporters generally rallied around their embattled leader. Borg Olivier still won the 1962 general election and crowned his long political career by achieving Independence for Malta in 1964. In the 1966 elections, Ganado's PDN and the other two small centre parties failed to win any seats and were eventually dissolved.\nBorg Olivier and Ganado argued in the newspapers - see pdf link below.\u00a0\nBorg Olivier went through two other crises in his party, one in his early political career, and another near its end.\nThe first was in 1947 when party leader Nerik Mizzi returned from exile. Veteran MP Prof Guze Hyzler (who had been elected in 1932) wanted a fresh, more liberal PN and eventually went on to form the Democratic Action Party. Borg Olivier was reportedly offered a position within the party, but stayed loyal to Mizzi and eventually succeeded him in 1950. The DAP won four seats in 1947 and just one in the 1950 elections. It was dissolved shortly after.\nThen in 1974, the PN, in Opposition, faced serious policy divisions over Borg Olivier's insistence that a referendum must be held to decide whether Malta should become a republic. No referendum was held, and Borg Olivier and another five Nationalist MPs (out of a total of 26) voted in parliament against the Republican Constitution, which was approved since it had won the votes of more than two-thirds of the House of Representatives. But the party held together, although Borg Olivier was persuaded to resign as party leader a few months after losing the 1976 elections.\nThe only other time since then that the PN faced something of a split, however minor, was when Josie Muscat was the only Nationalist MP who in 1987 voted against amendments to the Constitution to ensure majority rule and also, controversially, Malta's neutrality and non-alignment. He had clashed with the party after holding unauthorised talks with Prime Minister Dom Mintoff to break the constitutional impasse caused when the PN, winning an absolute majority of votes in the 1981 elections, ended up with a minority of seats due to gerrymandering.\nDr Muscat, who had set up a right-wing group, Front Freedom Fighters, then left politics before reappearing briefly as the head of a small party, Azzjoni Nazzjonali, which unsuccessfully contested the 2008 elections. In the last general election Dr Muscat was a PN candidate once more, but failed to be elected\nLabour\u2019s splits \u2013 Mintoff ousted the party leader in 1949, then brought down the government in 1998\nBy far the best known political split occurred 70 years ago within the Labour Party, when young minister Dom Mintoff managed to oust veteran leader Paul Boffa.\nThe Labour Party was even more powerful than it is today, having won just under 60% of the vote and 24 seats in the Legislative Assembly in 1947. But Mintoff viewed Boffa as being too soft with the British authorities in disputes over discharges from the dockyard and Britain\u2019s failure to give Malta a share of Marshall Aid. He resigned as works minister and started holding rival political events, bitterly attacking Boffa and going so far as to accuse him of incest.\nPaul Boffa with Mabel Strickland.\nMatters came to a head in October 1949 at the Labour Party's general conference when Mintoff successfully moved a motion of no confidence in Boffa and was elected party leader instead. Five other Labour MPs followed Mintoff.\nBoffa and the other 17 Labour MPs left the party and became known as the Boffa Labour Group (BLG). In the elections held in 1950, the Labour Party and the BLG each obtained 11 seats, but the Nationalist Party, with 12 seats, formed a minority government under Enrico Mizzi, who died in office three months later. This was defeated a few months later, with fresh elections held in 1951.\nBy this time Boffa had set up the Malta Workers Party (MWP), which won seven seats to Labour's 14. The Nationalists, now led by George Borg Olivier, won 15, and formed a coalition government with the MWP.\nThe coalition was restored after another election in 1953 (which saw the PN win 18 seats and MWP three) but only lasted till 1955. In that year's election, the MWP had disappeared and most Boffisti went back to Labour. Mintoff won 23 seats and thus was able to form a government.\nIn the 1970s, Mintoff erected a larger than life-size monument to Boffa at the top of Merchants Street, facing the Auberge de Castille.\nMintoff was to cause another split in the Labour Party in 1998 when he broke ranks with Prime Minister Alfred Sant, on a motion concerning the development of the Cottonera Waterfront, which Mintoff opposed but which Sant declared to be a vote of confidence. Denying the Labour government its one-seat parliamentary majority, Mintoff forced Sant to hold elections just 22 months into its five-year term, which Labour lost.\nMabel Strickland, Toni Pellegrini and Dom Mintoff (right).\nBut Mintoff himself had suffered a split within his party while he was in opposition in the 1960s and on the warpath against the Church. His tactics were too much for a section of the party. Led by Toni Pellegrini, Labour\u2019s erstwhile general secretary, they formed the Christian Workers\u2019 Party in 1961.\nPellegrini, like Ganado, won four seats in the 1962 general election but the party only lasted till 1966, with most of its members eventually returning to Labour, including Pellegrini himself.\nSplit of the once strong Constitutional Party\nThe Constitutional Party under Sir (later Lord) Gerald Strickland was one of the major political forces before the war and led a government in a compact with Boffa\u2019s Labour Party from 1927 to 1930. Its strength peaked in 1939, when it won six of the ten seats on the Council of Government, but waned in the war years, especially after Lord Strickland died in 1940. The party, now led by Strickland's nephew, Roger Strickland, was dissolved in 1946, only to be reconstituted in 1950, when it won four seats, as it did in 1951.\nHowever in 1952 Lord Strickland's daughter Mabel declared herself an independent in protest against the party's stand against the PN/MWP coalition and its alignment with Mintoff.\nIn 1953 the Constitutional Party successfully unseated Mabel Strickland on the grounds that her company had been given a government contract, and she went on to found the Progressive Constitutional Party, which fought that year's elections, which were also contested by the rump Constitutional Party.\nNeither PCP nor CP won any seats. PCP went on to contest the 1955 election, also unsuccessfully, but Mabel Strickland was elected in 1962. The party unsuccessfully fought the 1966 and 1971 elections, after which it was dissolved.\n\u00a0", "comment_count": 30, "id": 869}, {"keywords": "", "author": "Denise Grech ", "article_body": "Updated at 2.39pm\nThe European Commission has urged Malta to address aggressive tax planning systems, consider raising its retirement age and focus on fixing road congestion problems.\u00a0\nIn a country-specific report issued on Wednesday, the Commission listed recommendations which also included calls to strengthen judicial independence and to create a separate prosecution service.\u00a0\n'Aggressive' tax planning\nMalta was advised to address \"features of the tax system that may facilitate aggressive tax planning by individuals and multinationals, in particular by means of outbound payments\", in a country specific report issued on Wednesday by the European Commission.\nAnti-money laundering\nThe report also recommended that the country should continue the ongoing progress made on strengthening the anti-money laundering framework, notably regarding enforcement.\u00a0\nA delegation from the European Commission was here last March and had already said that Malta had not made any significant progress in the fight against corruption.\nRead: European Commission's appraisal of Malta: not entirely \u2018outstanding\u2019\nRoad congestion concerns\nMalta needed to invest in the untapped potential for energy efficiency and renewables, water-management cycle and waste management, the report said.\nIt also needed to tackle the growing emissions from air conditioning and car use.\n\"Road congestion is one of the weakest aspects of Malta\u2019s business environment and remains a major challenge,\" it said.\nMalta\u2019s fiscal energy consumption is constantly on the rise, the report warned, adding investments across sectors are needed in the short-term to meet 2020 targets.\nThe environmental and social costs of the housing boom require closer monitoring, the report said.

Apart from failing to retain St Paul\u2019s Bay, it lost Mosta and Si\u0121\u0121iewi, failed to win Birkirkara back, and for the first time ever it even lost control of Valletta. Munxar was the only council the PN managed to sway in its favour.\nSan \u0120wann also switched to Labour, even though the PN registered a marginal increase of votes there.

Taking a cue from pronouncements of the European Court of Human Rights, he argued that while the State had legislated to ensure people had a place of abode, it had neglected the interests of property owners.\nHe wrote: \u201cPrivate individuals can never be called upon to bear the burden of social measures designed to protect and safeguard other citizens, for as long as [the private individuals] are not adequately compensated [by the State]\u201d. Dr Debono, one of the leading specialist lawyers in property rights cases, revealed that since that sentence was delivered he has had other property owners in the same situation inquiring about initiating lawsuits.\n\u201cSome people want to forge ahead with filing causes in spite of the appeal \u2013 there is the feeling that the original judgment will be upheld on appeal \u2013 although others prefer to wait until the appeal is concluded.\u201d\nAll classes of pre-1995 rents have now been deemed unconstitutional in a string of judgments over the years that include the latest one. The number of households held under all the old rental laws has been estimated at around 32,000 by the NSO. That amounts to over 15 per cent of households in Malta.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe appeal that the government filed is expected to take six months to be decided.\u00a0\nOld rental laws all found unconstitutional\nThe constitutional courts have now denounced the two laws that regulate pre-1995 property rents \u2013 Chapter 158 and Chapter 69 \u2013 as well as the amendments of 2009 that were designed to bring the breaches of property rights under Chapter 69 to a gradual, managed resolution.\nChapter 158 governs properties that were originally leased under title of emphyteusis or ground rent \u2013 leased for a specified number of years at a specified annual ground rent \u2013 which were then converted into perpetual leaseholds by legal amendments in 1979.\nThis class of leaseholds were repudiated in a decisive judgment in 2009 \u2013 Amato Gauci vs Malta \u2013 by the ECHR. That court found that \u201ca disproportionate and excessive burden was placed on the applicant\u201d and that \u201cit follows that the Maltese State failed to strike the requisite fair balance between the general interests of the community and the protection of the applicant\u2019s right to property\u201d.\nThat judgment was reiterated in a string of subsequent lawsuits in Malta and Strasbourg.\nThen, in a 2014 case represented by Michael Camilleri, an associate of Mamo TCV Advocates, a Maltese constitutional court went further by ruling that tenancy governed by Chapter 158 could no longer be considered perpetual. This raised the spectre of eviction orders being sought. Eviction was averted in this case when the parties clinched an out-of-court arrangement.\u00a0\u00a0\nDr Camilleri, a human rights lawyer who has specialised in taking property rights cases to Strasbourg, talked to this newspaper about a seminal judgment at the turn of this year in one of his cases at the ECHR. It involved emphyteusis or ground rent agreed after 1979 which, despite the fact that the owner was cognizant of the legal restrictions on his ability to raise rent and get the tenants out, was still judged in breach of property rights.\n\u201cThe ECHR maintained that although the owner knew what he was signing up to, he couldn\u2019t predict how the law or situation would evolve over many years,\u201d said Dr Camilleri. \u201cLegal provisions granting tenants perpetual wide-ranging rights were problematic from that perspective. The ECHR looks at the wider situation, whether the law is balanced and proportionate \u2013 the rise in property prices means the owners have been subsidising the social welfare system.\u201d\nAmendments to Chapter 158 two years ago attempted to rebalance the competing interests by introducing a mechanism for owners to get a raise in rent and subsequently get the tenants out. Owners can now take the case to the Rent Regulation Board, presided by a magistrate, who can raise the rent to two per cent of the property price \u2013 the exact amount is set commensurately with the tenant\u2019s financial capability \u2013 and oblige the tenant to vacate the property after five years if he has sufficient means for alternative arrangements.\n\u201cThe problem is that these changes have introduced yet another court procedure, which costs money and takes time,\u201d Dr Camilleri said. \u201cMoreover, in case of a judgment from constitutional court saying tenancy is unconstitutional, the owner has to take the case to the Rent Regulation Board instead of filing directly for eviction. This matter has yet to be clarified.\u201d\nMeanwhile, the other old law \u2013 Chapter 69 \u2013 governed ordinary rents agreed between owner and tenant. It zealously protected tenants and their descendants from eviction and arbitrary increases in rent. The law was eventually changed in 1995: rents since 1995 have empowered owners to evict the tenant or raise the rent discretionally upon expiry of the private agreement. All the cases that are being challenged in court are of rents made prior to 1995, which are inheritable.\u00a0\nThese rents were modulated by Act X of 2009 in a bid to bring the complications arising from the unconstitutionality of rental laws to a gradual, managed closure. That law raised the bar for inheritance of rental agreements: heirs had to be living for four of five years prior to 2009 with the tenants and pass a means test. It uniformly raised rents to \u20ac185 annually, plus cyclical increases in keeping with cost of living indices \u2013 these rents currently stand at \u20ac209 annually.\n\u201cThe court [Mr Justice Mintoff] has now said that the rise in annual rent established by Act X of 2009 is in most cases insufficient given the disproportional market value of property,\u201d Dr Debono said. \u201cThis is what\u2019s innovative about the judgment.\u201d\nAnother innovation in the judgement is the pronouncement that perpetual tenancy under the provisions of Chapter 69 can no longer be assured. This doesn\u2019t imply automatic eviction. The highest court has maintained in past cases that it is not within the scope of the constitutional courts to order eviction; owners would have to request it in the ordinary civil court.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cThe trend in court decisions,\u201d Dr Camilleri said, \u201chas been to lean in favour of interests of property owners, but there are still obstacles and finer details in laws that complicate owners\u2019 property rights.\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0\nLaws that violate human rights remain unchanged\nMr Justice Mintoff\u2019s judgment \u201cdeclares\u201d that the laws governing the rent \u2013 Chapter 69 as well as Act X of 2009 \u2013 are \u201cinconsistent with Article 37(1) of the Constitution and Article 1 of the first protocol of the Convention [of human rights], and these laws can be considered as having no effect between the parties [owners and tenants].\u201d\nThe implication is that these legal provisions still stand for everyone else. Judge Emeritus Giovanni Bonello, who served at the ECHR, writes in his book Misunderstanding the Constitution that this situation has the \u201cdazzling effect of the very same law being valid and invalid at the same time\u201d.\nIn expanded comments to this newspaper, he said that having a law found to violate human rights to be only invalid for the particular plaintiff who challenged it \u201chas huge negative effects\u201d.\n\u201cAmong these, the courts are obliged to apply a law that the Constitutional Court has already found to be null and void. And every person in a similar situation has to reapply to the Constitutional Court to obtain a new declaration of nullity \u2013 an immense waste of resources and expenses.\u201d\nIn previous classes of leasehold cases, the string of constitutional challenges became a rhythm of repetition, with the same laws denounced for the same reasons. The ECHR has in recent years almost invariably raised damages awarded to property owners by the local courts.\nLast December, the Council of Europe\u2019s Venice Commission recommended devising a system common to much of the democratic world: the automatic revocation of any law deemed unconstitutional by the Constitutional Court.\u00a0\nIn Malta, discretionary power to amend or revoke any law deemed unconstitutional is vested in Parliament. Although the UK has a similar arrangement, the difference in Malta is that the Maltese Constitution expressly holds that the Constitution is the \u201csupreme law\u201d that \u201cshall prevail and any other law shall, to the extent of the inconsistency [with the Constitution], be void\u201d.\nIn this context, Judge Emeritus Bonello accuses the Constitutional Court of \u201cimpotence\u201d and \u201cabdication\u201d in his book which was serialised in this newspaper.\nWhen contacted, he elaborated on another \u201cnegative effect\u201d arising from the possibility \u201cthat the Constitutional Court can rule white in one case, black in the next, and white again in the third\u201d.\n\u201cCertainty of the law should be a cardinal principle for the courts,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cuncertainty of the law\u201d is a \u201ccarnival that only happens in Malta.\u201d \u00a0\nSocial aim of law on controlled rents: is it legitimate?\nThe number of rents governed by post-1995 legal provisions, which empowered owners to freely raise rents and evict tenants on expiry of private rental agreements, has been estimated at three to four per cent of households in Malta, or 6,000 to 8,000.\nThe rapid rises in property prices coupled with high demand have led this class of rents to thresholds of unaffordability for a cohort of middle earners. Stories of sudden spikes in rent pushing tenants into homelessness or miserable abodes, or to living at friends\u2019 or relatives\u2019 houses, have led to calls on the government to control rent prices.\nThe government has been reluctant to impose controls on prices, and in a White Paper issued last October it proposed instead a raft of measures designed to provide greater stability to tenants.\nYet price controls as such are not inherently anathema to constitutional courts. Dr Camilleri explained that the ECHR does consider \u201cwhether the law on controlled rents has a legitimate aim\u201d, including the \u201csocial aspect\u201d of any legislation.

having gone so far as to seek court action to block new appointments, and later to block the assignment of duties to new members of the judiciary, pending implementation of recommendations by the Venice Commission on the Rule of Law.\nDr de Gabriele pointed out that the final discretion still rested with the executive, and it was mainly up to politicians to address the situation through wider consultation with all those who could contribute towards a solution in line with the expectations of a modern society.\nThe independence and impartiality of the judiciary was not solely related to their appointment but also to the rigorous and intellectual integrity of every member called to the bench, irrespective of any role he or she may have occupied previously, Dr de Gabriele said.\nAs for the newly appointed judge, the Chamber President praised her efficiency and dedication in the handling of the caseload as a magistrate, especially in the Gozo Courts where she was known to deliver judgments on their due date and had even managed to resolve a case that had been pending for 40 years.\nThe promotion of magistrates to judges augured well, Dr de Gabriele continued, since their experience in the lower courts eased their transition from lawyers to members of the judiciary.\n\u201cYou have made this transition successfully,\u201d the Chamber president said.\nIn an emotional

varying ways to her success, bringing tears to her parents\u2019 eyes as they sat inside the packed courtroom.\nShe also thanked the Judicial Appointments Board who had nominated her to the bench of Judges.\nHaving regularly served on the Courts in Gozo, Madam Justice Vella Cuschieri made reference to the current pitiful state of the building housing the Gozo law courts, saying officials worked in damp, stuffy and overcrowded conditions.\nIn spite of this, they continued to prove themselves as a motivated team, the judge said, calling upon authorities to address the need for a new building
