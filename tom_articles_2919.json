He also said that Vertical Group Holding had seen projects suspended, which would have generated \"several hundreds of millions of euros of profits\", which were destined for major investment opportunities in Malta and elsewhere.\nLawyer Pio Valletta, who filed the lawsuit on Friday on behalf of Mr Agam and his company Vertical Group Holding, said this was not a simple case of defamation and breach of banking fiduciary duties, but involved \"a pattern of anti-Semitic acts, actions, statements and criminal behaviours which stem from the respondent bank\u2019s and its officers\u2019 perennial and proven racial and anti-Semitic disposition\".\nThe clash between Mr Agam and the bank started in 2013, when he challenged the bank\u2019s position after hearing about allegations that it was supporting terrorist organisations in Iran, which were actively trying to undermine his home state of Israel. Mr Agam, who served in the Israel military as a member of a special elite force to combat terrorist organisations, had said it would be impossible for his family to retain links with the bank in these circumstances.\nThe allegations were later proved: in 2014, BNP Paribas had pleaded guilty to criminal charges and paid $9 billion after it was found to have continued to do business with countries under American sanctions over a 10-year period.\nAs proof of its anti-Semitic stance, he also said that in 2016, it had made a $40 million settlement after a Jewish employee was fired after he complained about being forced to sit through a training film that depicted Hitler and other Nazi imagery in \"a positive manner\".\nIn June 2010, he was canvassed by the bank to become its client, with multimillion assets being placed in its Singapore branch, which he said was done in order for the bank to avoid taxes in France.\nMr Agam and two of his companies were given facilities amounting to \u20ac27.5 million, which were fully repaid, while the third company - Vertical - had \u20ac10 million in its account, without any facility.\nAfter the clash in 2013, the bank commenced what was described as a \u00ab series of illegal actions contrary to contractual and statutory regulations to terminate the banking relationship\u00bb with the Agams, which he said were intended to \"destroy his assets and his and his family\u2019s good names\".\nIn a nutshell, the bank claimed that the facilities granted to one of his companies was in default and demanded full payment of \u20ac20 million within 10 days, without giving any justification for its decision. Mr Agam later found out that the action was taken after one of his properties was targetted by a French court, in a case which was subsequently dropped.\nMr Agam said that in February 2014, the CEO of the Singapore bank met him in Paris and Mr Agam agreed to terminate the banking relationship as long as the bank continued to honour its facilities to his sister. He repaid \u20ac20.2 million but the bank insisted on repayment of a further \u20ac6.2 million granted to another of his companies \u2013 which was not in arrears \u2013 with payment deferred till the end of 2014.\nHowever, the story did not end there and in 2015, the bank terminated the negotiations and commenced proceedings in Singapore and France to enforce the personal guarantees given by Jacob and Ruth Agam for her companies, escalating this to foreclosure proceedings against her properties in 2016.\nThe plight of the Agam family prompted four banks to come forward, offering help to settle the outstanding loans, but their approach was rebuffed by BNP Paribas.\nMr Agam claimed that Dr Lafarge-Sarkozy said in December 2015 that \"she was instructed to destroy the Agam family\u2019s name, in particular Jacob\u2019s, his reputation, business, companies and assets and to take everything that they possessed in France from cars, arts to the furniture, and that she will be happy to do so\".\nHe claims that at one point during legal proceedings, she referred to the siblings as \u201cces gens-la\u201d (\u201cthese people\u201d) \u2013 a phrase which the French Supreme Court had previously ruled as being anti-Semitic \u2013 and \u201cparasites\u201d lounging around in luxurious estates \u201cliving at the expense of the bank and part of an international financial world\u201d.\nIn July 2017, Ruth Agam and her companies filed a claim in the Tel Aviv district court against the bank, alleging multiple violations inspired by anti-Semitic motives, while in Singapore, Jacob Agam tried a different tack, and challenged the validity of a merger between the bank and its private banking French subsidiary. In May 2016, the Supreme Court of Singapore \u2013 which he said was chaired by the former lawyer of the bank and the former legal partner of its current legal representative in Singapore \u2013 re-affirmed the legality of the merger but did not address the various commercial disputes between the Agams and the banks.\n\nThe case drew media attention, and one of the subsequent articles in the The Straits Times claimed he was \u201ctrying to wriggle out of his financial obligations\u201d \u2013 which he claims was defamatory and did his reputation untold damage, prompting queries from other media as well as the banks and others persons and entities with whom he and his companies were conducting or were about to conduct investment transactions.\nThe chairman, CEO and legal counsel were brought into the case because of their \"failure to act\", which Mr Agam said was tacit approval of what the bank had done.\nThe company and Mr Agam reserved the right to bring forward a claim for damages.", "comment_count": 0, "id": 3151}, {"keywords": "", "author": "", "article_body": "A passenger was apprehended at the airport after he was found to be carrying \u20ac18,000 in cash which had not been declared.\nThe man, who was heading for Istanbul, was caught during routine operations at the MIA Departures lounge, by Customs officials from the Enforcement Unit.\nHis other luggage was off loaded from the aircraft and revealed more cash in different currencies.The total amounted to \u20ac18,366, of which \u20ac10,000 were returned to the passenger and the rest seized.The Police Anti-Money Laundering Section was informed and placed the passenger under arrest.

Mr Ciantar had also been armed with a knife.\nAs the farmer ran off, one of the thieves had given chase while the one wearing the helmet had punched the woman, ordering her to hand over money. The woman had later told the police that her husband had been carrying some \u20ac1,000 in cash when he fled the scene.\nLuckily, the robbers\u2019 plans were thwarted by the arrival of the police.\nThe couple had later identified their aggressors at the police station and had also confirmed their identity in court.\nThe proceedings before the Magistrates Court ultimately resulted in a conviction in November 2017 and a 9-month jail term for Mr Ciantar who filed an appeal.\nThe appellant\u2019s lawyer contested the conviction, stating that this had relied mainly on the victims\u2019 identification of the suspect which, in turn, had been unduly \u2018contaminated\u2019 by the officers\u2019 influence at the police station.\nHowever, the court observed that although such identification was always to be analysed with great caution, in this case the couple\u2019s version had been \u2018a precise one.\u2019\nThe evidence showed that the sole reason for Mr Ciantar\u2019s presence at the farmhouse was to commit the theft. Even though he had claimed that he had accompanied his friend without knowing what was in store, once there, he had gone along with the plan, his actions amounting to preparatory acts to the perpetration of the crime.\nLater, in his statement, Mr Ciantar had described the whole episode as a \u2018stupidity\u2019 and an \u2018adventure\u2019 which he would never repeat.\nThe probatory value of that statement which had not been released in the presence of a lawyer, was questioned by the appellant.\nHowever, the court of criminal appeal, presided over by Madam Justice Edwina Grima, in a marked departure from recent case law on this subject, declared that the issue needed to be analysed with greater caution in the light of a recent pronouncement by the ECHR which had marked a shift in former judicial criteria.\nIn the case Philippe Beuze vs Belgium, the Grand Chamber of the ECHR in November 2018 declared that in criminal proceedings, a statement by the accused when not assisted by a lawyer, was not to be automatically discarded as evidence, but its admissibility was to be first subjected to a twofold test.\nThe court was to see whether there existed compelling reasons for the right to a lawyer to be withheld and also to assess the overall fairness of the proceedings.\nIn this case, Mr Ciantar had consulted his trusted lawyer, Joseph Brincat, before the interrogation and had been well-assisted all throughout the court proceedings, Madam Justice Grima observed.\nMoreover, at the time of the attempted robbery, Mr Ciantar had been a 26-year old with 11 past convictions on his record and hence certainly did not qualify as a \u201cvulnerable person\u201d, the court continued, further noting that both the accused and his lawyer had been informed of the charges he was facing.\nThe suspect\u2019s statement had only served to corroborate the version of the couple who had been the main witnesses and who had identified Mr Ciantar as one of their aggressors.\nFinally, the court observed that the current right to legal assistance during interrogation did not actually translate into \u201cmuch effective assistance,\u201d since the lawyer could only intervene in exceptional circumstances, a proviso which did not figure under the relative EU Directive.\nIn the light of all this, the court declared that the accused\u2019s statement together with the victims\u2019 testimony served to confirm his guilt, thus rejecting the appeal and confirming punishment.", "comment_count": 0, "id": 3171}, {"keywords": "", "author": "Philip Leone Ganado", "article_body": "The Planning Authority will on Thursday decide on an application for an eight-storey hotel in Mellie\u0127a, which is recommended to be refused for breaching the height limitation policy.\nSpread over a vacant 3,600 square metre plot close to the Valyou supermarket, the proposal \u2013 submitted by Gozitan development company J Portelli Projects \u2013 includes 120 residential units, shops, a hotel, underground parking and garages.\nThe Mellie\u0127a local council, which had once hoped to acquire the previously government-owned land to build a new community centre, has objected to the development, describing it as \u201cintensive and incompatible\u201d with its surroundings.\nThe council also argues that planning policy does not allow for new hotels in designated residential areas, and has called for the hotel component and its restaurant, spa, gym and indoor pool facilities to be dropped from the plans.\nDespite recommending the plans for refusal, the PA case officer did not back up the council\u2019s arguments, concluding that the project was acceptable in principle from a planning point of view.\nIntensive and incompatible with its surroundings\nThe Design Advisory Committee and Environment and Resources Authority also raised no objections, with the latter concluding that the project was unlikely to have significant environmental or traffic impacts.\nHowever, the case officer concluded that the eight storeys proposed fell foul of the height limitation policy.

This is the second such report, the first having been carried out in 2002.\nThe IMF had also been asked by the government to assess its budgeting and presented its findings during the budget briefing last September.\nThe IMF's FSSA report issued on Thursday looked into other key metrics of the banking system \u2013 such as capitalisation and liquidity \u2013 saying that although it was in good health, challenges existed.\n\u201cThe banking system remains resilient under a severe scenario, with weaknesses limited to a few small banks. The system is sufficiently capitalised to absorb losses in the event of a severe macroeconomic shock, but risky exposures would lead to potential losses at a few small banks.\u201d\n\u201cContinued enhancements are encouraged in the macroprudential framework. While the recent strengthening of systemic risk monitoring is commendable, the legal framework should be enhanced, data gaps closed, and non-bank risk assessment strengthened. The planned introduction of borrower-based measures to address build-up of vulnerabilities in the housing and household sector is welcome,\u201d it said.\nThe report also referred to the closure of banks - without mentioning either Pilatus or Satabank by name - saying that the MFSA should strengthen its supervisory and early intervention procedures, \"including to mitigate its legal risks\". One recommendation was to reduce the time in office for the competent person appointed to manage the affairs of a bank.\nMFSA chairman John Mamo picked out the IMF\u2019s comments on the authority\u2019s needs for more resources:\n\u201cThe report highlights the challenges facing the MFSA from the increased demands of supervising the growing number of licensed financial institutions in an evolving and more complex regulatory environment, as well as the need to upgrade the MFSA\u2019s operational capacity to enable it to operate more effectively.\u201d\nWith regards to the IMF\u2019s call for strong supervision and enforcement, he said the recommendations had been noted.\nThe report was welcomed by the Governor of the Central Bank of Malta, Mario Vella, who noted its general positive outlook on financial stability risks in Malta, and the recommendations made, adding that these mainly reflect enhancements to the work already being carried out by the Central Bank.\n\n\n\n\nWhat it said about the MFSA:\nThe review of supervisory measures reveals that the MFSA\u2019s actions have not always been timely and effective. Significant delays exist between the end of onsite inspections and the date on which decisions were taken by the SC. The low and limited number of monetary sanctions has little deterrent effect.\nMoreover, the limited scope of onsite inspections (low frequency and keyrisks insufficiently covered) impair the detection of problems, including in the ML/TF area. Judicial appeals against monetary sanctions have suspensive effects, undermining the sanctions policy (e.g., MFSA has 27 pending appeals with some dating back to 2009).\nThe authorities should eliminate delays in supervisory actions (including by amending the law if needed) and take full advantage of the broad enforcement powers.\nImportant shortcomings in bank supervision practices need to be addressed. MFSA needs to complete the rollout of its supervision strategy, including the completion of the Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process for all HPLSIs, and address the low frequency of onsite inspections at LSIs. A more intrusive approach is needed to assess banks\u2019 risk-management processes, including for asset recovery, related-party transactions, forbearance measures, andcollateral valuation. The focus should be on the main risks (credit, liquidity, and compliance), the adequacy of risk classification and provisioning, and on stronger follow-up on remediation progress.\nAny possible limitations on the judicial review of supervisory/resolution actions should strike a balance between the right and a legitimate need for judicial review and the effectiveness of such actions.\nDespite improvements, the related-party framework exhibits significant gaps with the BCP, requiring further action. Legal amendments are needed to increase MFSA\u2019s powers and banks\u2019 obligations related to: (i) the change of legal structures; (ii) major acquisitions; (iii) the review of the activities ofcompanies affiliated with banks\u2019 parent companies; and (iv) the communication of materially adverse developments. Finally, the authorities should improve the supervision of non-EU branches.\n\n\n\n\nRead the full report here.\u00a0\nPN REACTION\nIn a reaction to the IMF report, the Nationalist Party observed that the European Commission had noted that Malta's economic performance, although positive, was facing sustainability challenges.\u00a0\nThe report noted that \"children in single-parent, and medium-skilled families are at greater risk of poverty.\" With regards to public finance, the report commented on the increase in public expenditure stating that government was financing permanent expenditure with temporary income.\n\"This equates with what the Opposition has repeatedly stated, that is that government is recklessly increasing public expenditure basing its spending patterns on income, including income from proceeds of the IIP scheme, which might decrease sharply in the near future.\"\nThe PN also noted the IMF concerns about serious shortcomings in Malta's anti-money laundering enforcement framework, adding that \"no significant steps have been taken to strengthen enforcement of the anti-corruption framework\".\n\u00a0The report noted that the MFSA's actions had not always been timely and effective.\nA new legislative anti-money laundering framework entered into force in 2018, but according to the\u00a0 European Commission, the transposition of the EU's Fourth AML Directive was not complete and recent bank intervention cases exposed serious shortfalls in the framework.\nThe PN said such reports echoed the positions adopted by the Opposition and other organisations over the past months.

On November 23, Bombardier Schembri was summoned before Commander Jeffrey Curmi who informed him that what he had done had amounted to insulting and denigrating behaviour towards the Army and the Commander himself, thereby meriting a dismissal.In the application filed before the First Hall, Civil Court, the former soldier\u2019s legal team claimed that such decision breached the applicant\u2019s fundamental right not to be tried twice and was \u201cdiscriminatory\u201d and \u201cunreasonable\u201d.\nIndeed, although the video was shared by someone else, it was only Mr Schembri who had faced dismissal, the lawyers argued.The Commander\u2019s action had also run counter to the principle of \u2018fair hearing\u2019 since he had chosen to take the matter into his own hands, \u201cdisciplining the person who had criticised him during the light moment\u201d.The soldier\u2019s dismissal amounted to an administrative act which had failed to abide by procedural rules and which clearly breached the principles of natural justice, thereby qualifying for judicial review in terms of article 469A of the Code of Organisation and Civil Procedure.\nThe applicant thereby requested the court to declare the Commander\u2019s decision as \u2018ultra vires,\u2019 therefore null and void and to liquidate damages payable by the AFM Commander in his regard.\nLawyers Joseph Giglio, Franco Debono, Marion Camilleri and Mario Spiteri signed the sworn application.", "comment_count": 22, "id": 3183}, {"keywords": "", "author": "", "article_body": "Five hundred days after the assassination of Daphne Caruana Galizia, the masterminds of her murder were still enjoying impunity and power, Re\u017cistenza Malta said on Thursday.\nThe pressure group placed a placard in Bidnija on the 500th day anniversary of her death saying\u00a0\nIn a statement, it said no journalist was ever murdered for a lie, but in revenge to the truth they uncovered or to stop them from discovering and exposing uncomfortable truths.\nIf one felt slandered, he had a legal remedy to expose the deceit of the accuser.
