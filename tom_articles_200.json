Such MPs hold appointments as \u201cpersons of trust\u201d or on \u201ccontracts of service\u201d in government ministries, or as chairpersons or members of the boards of directors of public authorities, or else they have been given consultancy contracts with ministries or public authorities.The Commissioner noted that giving backbench MPs jobs with government is widely perceived as a means of appeasing those who are not appointed as ministers or parliamentary secretaries, or as a means of compensating them for their low salaries as MPs. He called upon Parliament to address the issue of low remuneration of MPs.\n'Practice started under previous administrations' - government\nIn a statement, the government said the report itself had acknowledged that the same practice had been adopted by previous administrations and concerned MPs on both sides of the House.\nThe government said the Commissioner had also acknowledged legal advice that the practice of appointing MPs as consultants to government or related entities was not contrary to the Constitution.\nThe government also highlighted the Commissioner's remarks that ending the practice would require an increase in MPs' salaries.\nIt said it would be studying the report in further detail.\u00a0", "comment_count": 94, "id": 1919}, {"keywords": "Education", "author": "Jacob Borg", "article_body": "Updated 12.25am with NGO reaction\nA report by the Education Commissioner has sounded the alarm about the \u201cworrying and dangerous\u201d phenomena of group-bullying being carried out by \u201cethnic gangs\u201d in an unnamed school.\u00a0\nIn the report published by the Ombudsman\u2019s office, the Education Commissioner warned that \u201ccurricular dystopia\u201d and troubled social backgrounds was leading to the formation of these gangs.\u00a0\nIn a statement, NGOs slammed the comments as \"careless and misinformed\", arguing that while the shift to multicultural classrooms had brought tensions, the Commissioner's asssessment was steeped in stereotypes and ignored the increased risks of bullying faced by migrant and ethnic minority students.\u00a0\nEducation Commissioner Charles Caruana Carabez set about investigating cases of bullying within the unnamed school after noticing the high amount of reported incidents.\u00a0\n\u201cThough bullying is by no means a recent phenomenon, the Commissioner has data which indicates that there is a link between the number of cases of bullying recorded in a school and the number of students belonging to a particularly nationality in that school,\u201d the report says.\u00a0\nMr Caruana Carabez said non-Maltese students were being forced to follow curricula which are tailored for Maltese students but are not considered useful by foreign students.\u00a0\nThis was complicated by the fact that some foreign students cannot even speak or understand Maltese or English with an intermediate proficiency.\u00a0The language barrier instinctively leads such students into seeking the company of peers from their own country\nThe language barrier instinctively leads such students into seeking the company of peers from their own country, the report continues, and the more students from that particularly country, the larger and more powerful the gang will be. Students\u2019 fraught social backgrounds was another factor identified by the Education Commissioner behind the formation of such gangs.\u00a0\nMr Caruana Carabez said the troublesome foreign students seem to come from war-torn countries, and may have been brutalised by being exposed to violence at an early age.\u00a0\nOthers may come from countries whose citizens have been rendered \u201csoulless\u201d by political regimes.\u00a0\nThe Commissioner also noted how students coming from a family background that was \u201cfar from ideal\u201d were also prone to trouble.\u00a0\n\u201cThe latter is becoming increasingly applicable to Maltese students, who, of course, form an obviously numerically-important part of the school environment. Vast cultural differences also play an important role,\u201d the Commissioner said in the report.\u00a0\nThe Commissioner expressed his belief that the root cause aggravating the problem also lies in the fact that a school which was conceived and administered as a normal secondary school, had suddenly turned into an international school though \u201csuddenly changed demographic circumstances\u201d.\u00a0\nHe said this happened without the school having the necessary structures, curricula or human resources suitable for it to operate as an international school.\u00a0\n\u201cMalta\u2019s population underwent a significant change in that the number of foreign expatriates increased dramatically and within a relatively short period as a result of geo-political upheavals and economic turmoil in both Europe and Northern Africa, and a sizable proportion of these foreign expatriates who work or seek refuge in Malta have families with children who need education.\u00a0\nMr Caruana Carabez expressed his belief that the setting up of a centrally-located international school where the students were taught in their own language and their particular cultures form part of the curriculum would go a long way to eliminate the \u201caberrant behaviour\u201d emanating from boredom and subject irrelevance.\u00a0\n\u201cThe Commissioner is aware, however, that this solution is fraught with difficulties and would offer a considerable challenge to the government,\u201d Mr Caruana Carabez concluded.\u00a0\n'Commissioner seems to be advocating for segregation' - NGOs\nIn a statement, a group of 19 human rights and social justice NGOs acknowledged that the transition to multicultural classrooms had been \"marked by tension and struggle\" and insisted the challenges faced by educators, administrators and students could not be ignored.\u00a0\nHowever, the NGOs said the Commissioner's analysis provided a \"one-sided perspective\" that ignored growing evidence based on the experiences of migrant and ethnic minority students.\u00a0\n\"It is disconcerting that his evaluation appears to be steeped in cultural stereotypes and hearsays that fail to capture the complexity of the context,\" the groups said.\u00a0\n\"We also note that the Commissioner ignores the demonstrated strengths and benefits of the pluricultural and plurilingual classroom. We believe that a classroom environment embracing different worldviews and cultural practices, encourages students to absorb knowledge and skills necessary to navigate an increasingly globalised world.\n\"Instead, the Commissioner seems to be advocating for separation and segregation.\"\nThe NGOs highlighted the fact that the 2014 national policy on bullying had identified migrant and ethnic minority children as vulnerable and more susceptible to bullying, and lamented that the Commissioner had not assessed whether this policy was achieving its aims in safeguarding victims of bullying.\u00a0\nThey also questioned why no mention had been made of the fundamental human right to education, in light of the Commissioner's core duty\u00a0to improve the educational services for all members of the community, especially the most vulnerable.\n\"The undersigned non-governmental organisations therefore flag the Commissioner\u2019s report as inappropriate.

A play can offer a more subtle, humane, and measured approach that allows listeners to draw their own conclusions. Undeniably Daphne's tenacity and impressive energy are present in the storytelling.\u201d\nStarring Game of Thrones actress Michelle Fairley in the role of Daphne, the series describes itself as an \u201cattempt to piece together a picture of what might have happened behind the headlines\u201d and begins each episode with an acknowledgement: \u201cThere is much we cannot know and much we had to imagine.\u201d\nMichelle Fairley, known for playing Catelyn Stark in Game of Thrones, plays journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia\nFact and Fiction\nIn researching the drama, Ms Nunnery visited Malta and met various people who knew Ms Caruana Galizia, speaking to colleagues and acquaintances and digesting a huge amount of writing from those for and against her work. But while the series is structured around true events - threats from the far-right in 2005, Ms Caruana Galizia\u2019s arrest before the 2013 general election, the Panama Papers and Egrant stories in recent years - conversations, relationships and moments from her investigations are all fictionalised.\u201cUsing the evidence of her journalism, I imagined the path she might have followed to get to the information she presented publicly,\u201d Ms Nunnery said of the many meetings with sources depicted in the series.\nDaphne Caruana Galizia, pictured at Mosta Police Station in 2013 after being arrested for breaching the pre-election media blackout\nSome of these imaginings may be only slightly removed from truth: Ms Nunnery said the character of an editor whom Daphne berates for refusing to publish a story is fictionalised, but illustrates mounting frustrations which led to her starting her blog. Others are more speculative: such as a meeting with a source in the Maltese financial sector who provides information that actually emerged from the international Panama Papers leak, or a two-hour stakeout of the gaming authority for a comment on financial fraud.\nMixed legacy\nAnd while the series is clearly focused on what Ms Nunnery called the \u201cthematic debate around freedom of speech, democracy and alleged corruption\u201d it does not altogether shy away from criticism of Ms Caruana Galizia\u2019s work.Her equal readiness to cover government corruption or a salacious affair is referred to in one episode, in others her husband questions her use of \u201cbullying language\u201d and her reliance on a single source for a major story, while a confrontation with a political opponent in the street brings up accusations of classism and unwarranted personal attacks. Nevertheless, the series - or the decision to embark on one at all - has been criticised as a form of whitewashing of her legacy: MaltaToday editor Saviour Balzan, a long-time critic of Ms Caruana Galizia, hit out at it for \u201cportraying her as some sort of saint on earth\u201d.\nLizzie Nunnery, who wrote BBC docudrama Daphne: A Fire in Malta\nAsked about this, Ms Nunnery suggested the criticism - which came before all episodes had aired - were less a response to the series itself than to the broader context surrounding it. \u201cThere are many moments in the series when other characters challenge or question Daphne's actions or assumptions. I tried hard to show the complex public figure she was in Malta, and what fuelled the passionately different opinions of her,\u201d Ms Nunnery said. \u201cThe motivation in making the series was to explore a resonant and complex human story, presenting important questions about society and the individual that travel far beyond Malta.

To this end, Prime Minister Joseph Muscat had called the law a \u201clandmark\u201d piece of legislation because its effects were intended to thoroughly change the mentality prevailing in the country.\nThe approach which had been taken in the drafting of the law was to address some of the consequences of the \u201cgreat economic leap forward\u201d which the country had experienced in recent years, and which had reinvigorated the rental and property markets. The \u201cmiddle-of-the-road\u201d approach adopted by the government would take into account the needs of the rental market while making the leasing of accommodation viable.\nIn terms of the new legislation, lessors would be bound to register new rental contracts within 30 days, and would be able to do so online or through the offices of the Housing Authority.\nAlthough the signing of a contract for every rental agreement had been envisaged in amendments to rental legislation introduced in 1995, many lessors were failing to live up to this obligation, leaving lessees at a loose end.\nThe law would render lessors failing to register contracts liable to pay a fine of up to \u20ac10,000. It would also allow lessees to register rental contracts themselves in cases where their respective lessor had failed to do so, at the lessor\u2019s expense.\nThe new law would prevent rental increases from being effected more than once a year, and would restrict these increases to the annual variation registered by the national Property Price Index. It would furthermore cap these increases at a maximum of five per cent per year.\nDr Galdes elaborated new rights for lessors as well as for lessees. In cases where tenants were in default of their obligations, he said, and proceedings were brought before the courts, a decision regarding whether the tenant should be evicted or not would be taken during the first court sitting. This would avoid a long wait for the lessor, returning access to the property while allowing other matters related to the eviction to be discussed during subsequent sittings.\nTenants defaulting on their obligations would also be \u201cblacklisted,\u201d in order to allow other lessors relative certainty about the reliability of those with whom they were entering into rental contracts.\nMinimum notice periods\nThe law would also introduce minimum notice periods for lessees\u2019 withdrawal from rental agreements, which would increase depending on the length of the original contract. It would also stipulate a minimum portion of the contract which would have to be honoured by the lessee.\nMr Galdes said that the changes would allow flexibility in the rental market while introducing and developing the best practices which had been adopted elsewhere. It would avoid problems faced by owners who were suddenly left to pay for unexpected damages, and of tenants whose rents were doubled at short notice. However, it was important to avoid \u201csolving today\u2019s problems with yesterday\u2019s mentality.\u201d\nOpposition MP Ivan Bartolo said the prime minister\u2019s statement that the reform would not impact current prices meant that those who were presently in an unpleasant situation would remain where they were. However, some of the aspects of the new law were a good start for further reforms.\nApart from further amendments which the Opposition would move at committee stage, Mr Bartolo proposed incentives for longer-term contracts. He suggested the removal of the five per cent cap on annual rent increases for contracts lasting longer than five years as one possible incentive.\nFurthermore, he said that the law presently obliged the lessor to summon the lessee in cases where the lessee was in default.

The pedestrian was trapped between his car and the second car.\nThe court observed that Mr Gatt had been diagnosed as having temporal cavernoma - which is a defect in the veins of the brain.\nHe suffered a type of epilepsy that caused absence seizures and automatism.\nHe was subsequently operated on in October 2016.\nThe court made reference to notes by former Chief Justice (and President) Prof. Anthony Mamo that \"the act alone does not amount to guilt, but must be accompanied by a guilty mind\".\nLater, Prof. Mamo also wrote on acts committed during sleep-like conditions, saying: \u201cNo men can be held criminally liable for anything done by him in his sleep.

But in any such exceptional case, any punishment which the law could inflict at all, would not be for the act done in sleep, but for the failure to take the necessary care when awake.\u201d\nAfter also referring to case law, the court observed that in this particular case, Mr Gatt was totally unaware of what had happened and appeared surprised and very confused when he was approached immediately after the crash.\nThe motorist had also made no attempt to stop the car and, according to eye-witnesses, the vehicle did not appear to be under control immediately before the accident.\nFirst seizure while driving\nThe court observed that at the time of the accident, Mr Gatt was already seeing a neurologist and taking medication. His dosage of epilim had been increased just six days before the accident, but he never previously experienced a seizure of this nature - \"never more than a second or two\"\u00a0- and never while driving.\nIt did not result that doctors had ever ordered Mr Gatt not to drive, although he had been warned not to swim in deep water and not to climb ladders.\nThe court said it found no link between the use of cannabis by the accused and his medical condition. The accident was not caused as a result of cannabis use, and a breathalyser test had also resulted negative.\nThe court, therefore, found Mr Gatt not guilty to having caused the pedestrian\u2019s death through carelessness, negligent driving and lack of observance of regulations.\nHe was however found guilty of simple possession of 0.46 grams of cannabis and fined \u20ac75.\nA request for the court to ban Mr Gatt from driving was denied. \u00a0\nDr Joseph Giglio and Dr Quentin Tanti appeared for the accused.", "comment_count": 0, "id": 1969}, {"keywords": "Accident, Traffic", "author": "", "article_body": "An 84-year-old man from Iklin was grievously injured when he was hit by a car in Birkirkara on Wednesday morning.\nThe police said the accident happened in John Borg Street at about 10.30am.\nThe car, a Mercedes, was being driven by a 27-year-old man from Birkirkara.\u00a0\nThe police are investigating.", "comment_count": 0, "id": 1970}, {"keywords": "Accident, Police", "author": "", "article_body": "A motorcyclist was hospitalised after she was injured in an accident on Wednesday.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe accident happened in Triq G\u0127ajn Dwieli, Cospicua at 12.10pm.\nThe police said the 52-year-old from Kalkara had been driving a Peugeot Tweet motorcycle which was involved in a crash with a Ford Ka driven by a 36-year-old Afghan man.\nThe woman was seriously injured.\u00a0\nA magisterial inquiry is under way.\u00a0\u00a0", "comment_count": 0, "id": 1971}, {"keywords": "Society, Politics", "author": "", "article_body": "Over three-quarters of the \u20ac1.7 billion budget for social protection in 2016 was spent on old age and health benefits, according to a comprehensive publication released on Wednesday by the National Statistics Office.\nThe budget increase by \u20ac70.3 million compared with 2015, with the largest rise \u2013 of \u20ac44 million \u2013 going to Social Security Contributory Benefits.\nSocial expenditure amounted to 16.5 per cent of the Gross Domestic Product, a ratio which put Malta in 24th place out of the 28 member states of the EU.\n\nAccording to the publication, more than half (54.6 per cent) of Malta\u2019s 2016 social protection outlay was made up of cash benefits which are not subject to means-testing.\nOverall, 165,815 persons or 36 per cent of the Maltese population received at least one type of social security benefit, with 88,479 people receiving an old age type pension.\nThe average social security recipient received \u20ac4,823 in benefit income.\n\nYou can read the full publication below.", "comment_count": 3, "id": 1972}, {"keywords": "Gozo, Civil society, Court", "author": "", "article_body": "Outraged astronomers and environmentalists have launched a crowdfunding appeal in the hopes of drumming up the \u20ac2,000 needed to appeal a decision to allow a restaurant at a sensitive site in Dwejra to expand.\nFifteen organisations, ranging from the University of Malta's Institute of Space Sciences and Astronomy to Moviment Graffitti and Birdlife Malta, have put their name to the crowdfunding appeal.\nThe funds raised would be used to file a court appeal against an Environmental Planning Tribunal decision taken last week which will effectively allow the Azure Window Restaurant in Dwejra to become bigger and brighter.\n\n\u20ac2,000 would allow activists to cover the costs of filing the appeal as well as paying for any eventual fines incurred should the court appeal be unsuccessful.\u00a0\nActivist Cami Appelgren indicated in a post on Facebook that the target was within reach\nThe Tribunal overturned an earlier rejection by the Planning Authority and prompted an outpouring of anger among environmentalists.

Why didn't you tell the police? You put your cousin in a lot of trouble?\" I thought I would cause more trouble.\nA parting shot: \"Or is it because you actually said the truth then, and not now?\"\u00a0\nThe witness sticks to his version. The court has paused for a break of a few minutes.\u00a0\n11.45am For some time, the court has been focused on an apparent inconsistency in the witness's statements: was it Lorin Scicluna, alone, who told him about the shooting, as the witness said in court today? Or was it his cousin, Francesco Fenech, as he had allegedly said on an earlier occasion in police custody?\nThe witness insists the correct version is what he said today under oath, that Scicluna had told him everything. \"I had been under shock, and under arrest, when I said Francesco had told me about his involvement,\" he says. \"I wanted to put pressure on him. I didn't known who was telling the truth.\"\nThe magistrate warns him that his job is not to act as an investigator.\u00a0\n11.40am The witness, Dylan German, is asked yet again whether he and Lorin Scicluna were alone when the accused told him about the shooting. \"Yes, I'm sure, I'm sure, I'm sure,\" he says. But Inspector Keith Arnaud now asks him about a confrontation with his cousin (the other accused, Francesco Fenech) in police custody. The inspector says the witness had said then that his cousin had himself told him about the shooting.\u00a0\n\"Sorry, I forgot something,\" the witness says, now adding that his cousin had told him he had been at the\u00a0pastizzeria, where Scicluna worked, before the shooting.

He insists Lorin Scicluna had implicated his cousin after telling the witness about the murder, because he was worried the witness would go to the police.\u00a0\nLawyer Franco Debono now asks whether German is certain has cousin wasn't there when Scicluna told him about the murder (two weeks after it happened). \"I'm sure,\" German says. \"We were alone in my garage at the time\".\u00a0 Was his cousin present at any time? \"It could be\". Had he dropped by at all that day? \"I'm not sure\".\u00a0\nInspector Keith Arnaud, the prosecutor officer, steps in: the defence lawyer has asked this question a million times, he says. The questioning takes a different turn.\u00a0\n11.25am Franco Debono (appearing for Lorin Scicluna) now asks why the witness had been shocked to hear of his cousin Francesco Fenech's possible involvement in the shooting when he knew Fenech had already been with Scicluna when they kicked a migrant's bike. \"Perhaps because a person was killed,\" the witness replies quickly. \"I believe everyone would be shocked.\"\nHe passes comments about Dr Debono\u2019s line of cross examination, but the magistrate intervenes, instructing him to answer the questions without any further arguments.\n_______________________________________________________________\nLassana Cisse was killed in \u0126al Far on April 6.\n_________________________________________________\nScicluna's defence lawyer starts cross-examination\n11.20am\u00a0Franco Debono, appearing for Lorin Scicluna, is now questioning the witness. Why did you label Scicluna a \"Nazi\" when you couldn't remember the exact words he told you or the place where it happened, he asks. The witness says Scicluna had spoken to him face-to-face and used foul language when referring to migrants.\u00a0\nQuestioning turns to the visits Scicluna and the witness had made to the shooting range. Scicluna had taken more than 100 shots at a target, an A4-sized circle drawn on a board, the witness says. The distance between shooter and target was between 15 and 25 metres.\u00a0\n_______________________________________________________________\nGerman says Scicluna asked for help with bust gun barrel\n11.10am\u00a0The cross-examination continues. Defence lawyer Giannella de Marco asks about the time Lorin Scicluna wanted advice about busting a gun barrel. The gun's riflings, which mark the bullet and make it possible to trace it back to the gun, would be totally destroyed, the witness says.\nAsked what he had been told about the night of the murder, German says Scicluna had said he fired at several migrants and stopped because of a weapon malfunction. The witness says he was shocked and angry at hearing this, knowing \"he would lose his good job and get into trouble\".\u00a0\n_______________________________________________________________\nFenech's defence lawyer starts cross-examination\n11.05am Defence lawyer Giannella de Marco (appearing for Francesco Fenech) is now starting a cross-examination. She asks about the first time the witness met Lorin Scicluna: it was just chance that Scicluna's car had stopped close to his house, the witness says, and he had helped restart it. Was Scicluna a good shot when they visited the shooting range? Very, the witness says. Scicluna's lawyers object to the question, pointing out that targets at the range were stationary.\u00a0\n_______________________________________________________________\nGerman grew suspicious after reading of a Toyota\u00a0\n11am Dylan German says he texted his cousin after hearing of the shooting on the news, warning him not to keep bad company. \"What made you do that,\" inspector Keith Arnaud asks. German says he knew Lorin Scicluna had a Toyota Starlet and became suspicious when media reports spoke of same type of car involved in the shooting.\u00a0\n_______________________________________________________________\nDylan German says Fenech denied involvement\n10.55am The witness says his cousin, Francesco Fenech, denied having had anything to do with the shooting, breaking in tears and swearing he had only been involved in a separate incident where he and Lorin Scicluna had kicked a migrant's bike. Scicluna, meanwhile, told German he had thrown ammunition into the sea at Delimara and had removed his car's number plates before the April 6 murder.\u00a0\nThe witness, Dylan German, says he had been asked by police to confront Francesco during interrogation. \"I was rather confused at that time,\" he says. \"I didn\u2019t know whom to believe.\" German reiterates that his cousin had always denied any involvement. He says the two grew up together - Fenech is the younger by three years - and that his cousin had never shown any signs of racism and violence.\u00a0\n_______________________________________________________________\n\n_________________________________________________\n\u2018Scicluna told me he fired shots'\n10.50am Dylan German, cousin of one of the accused, is currently testifying. He says that Lorin Scicluna opened up to him about the murder after asking his advice about busting up a gun barrel.\nGerman says Scicluna told him he had been at work at the\u00a0pastizzeria\u00a0before having a drink, going home and fetching his gun, driving to\u00a0\u0126al Far for the murder. He said he had had a drink too many, that he had shot eight or 10 rounds at several black people, and that Francesco Fenech (German's cousin) had been with him.\u00a0\n_______________________________________________________________\nGerman describes co-accused Lorin Scicluna as a \u2018Nazi\u2019\n10.40am\u00a0The witness says Lorin Scicluna had a semi-automatic pistol he sometimes used when they went to the shooting range together, while other times they would use weapons loaned at the facility.\nBut he says Scicluna once made a comment about a black passer-by, which made him think of Scicluna as a \"Nazi\". Another time, Scicluna asked him for advice on how to bust up a gun barrel, which the witness says he strongly advised him not to do because of the danger. The witness says Scicluna never told him his intentions, but that he realised there was something wrong.\u00a0\n_______________________________________________________________\nDylan German, cousin of accused Francesco Fenech testifies\n10.35am Dylan German, Francesco Fenech's cousin, is the next to testify.

Moreover, the unattractiveness of the profession as a result of increased work demands and low professional esteem has steered graduate teachers away from the profession altogether, she said.\nEfforts to dignify the teaching profession severely lacking\nMs Mizzi said that research on the organisational factors affecting teachers in Maltese schools has remained limited to quantitatively assessing causes of stress, burnout, and job dissatisfaction.\nFindings showed that teachers\u2019 understanding of their own well-being centred on feelings of overall contentment, good mental health, and job satisfaction.\nIn Maltese public secondary schools, a state of well-being was perceived to be conditioned by students\u2019 diversity and behaviour, school population, workload, collegiality, physical school environment, leadership practices, and organisational support.\nWhile personal resilience was useful for teachers to develop coping strategies to deal with instances of negative well-being in the workplace, participants advocated the need for more emotional awareness during teacher training.\nShe said many of the people interviewed for this study argued that university courses did not adequately prepare them for the exigencies of the job, resulting in a poor life-work balance, strained relationships, and excessive stress, specifically in the first years of teaching.\nFundamentally, participants felt that efforts to dignify the teaching profession in Malta were severely lacking, which was reflected in the lack of professional consultation, lower rates of student intakes for the job, and higher rates of teacher attrition in Malta, she said.\nTeachers also claimed that public perceptions of the profession, as well as incessant curricular changes and expectations also had a negative effect on their well-being.\nMs Mizzi said that to her surprise, only a third of the participants were aware of the employee support programme offering free counselling services to all public employees in Malta.\nSmaller classes, reduced workloads, modernised working environments, more autonomy and overall respect for the profession were among the suggested remedial action.\nFindings extracted from participants\u2019 experiences suggest that while positive and negative workplace practices can influence teacher well-being, Malta still has a long way to go to effectively improve the well-being of teachers.\nMs Mizzi said that a student-centred approach in education should never underestimate the importance of educators.", "comment_count": 30, "id": 1979}, {"keywords": "Society, Family, Health", "author": "Claudia Calleja", "article_body": "Updated 6pm with warning by the Commissioner for Mental Health\nMalta may soon have a national suicide crisis line as mental health professionals will be coming together to discuss a way to make this happen, according to psychiatrist Mark Xuereb.\n\u201cA lot has already been done to tackle mental health, including suicide, but we need to work together.

Various support lines are already available for people suffering from mental health problems, including those having suicidal thoughts.

This means TMS may be considered for use only in cases of severe depression that has not responded to other forms of standard treatment, such as medication or psychotherapy, or where such forms of treatment may not be suitable. More safety studies are needed todetermine long term effects.\"\nThe commissioner urged the authorities to urgently implement the National Emergency Psychiatric Response Service, appropriately

"Updated at 11.55am\nThe Health Commissioner in the Ombudsman\u2019s Office has accused the government of \u201coppressing\u201d patients, denying them free and essential medicine they are entitled to and of repeatedly breaching laws by refusing to revise discriminatory protocols.\nIn the latest annual report for 2018, Commissioner for Health, Charles Messina, slammed the government for dragging its feet since 2013 to resolve discriminatory regulations which are denying patients their essential medicines.\nAccording to the report, the main issues between the commissioner and the Health Ministry are three.\nThese are the entitlement of free medicine in certain cases, which the government is denying due to costs; discriminatory protocols (rules) enacted by the government which determine the entitlement of certain medicines; and the provision of health services in some extraordinary cases.\n\u201cThe non-implementation of the recommendations about discriminatory and illegal protocols, recommended in 2013, is a very serious matter because they were meant to solve the discrimination and illegality created,\u201d the commissioner said.\n\u201cThe patients are purely and simply being oppressed,\u201d he charged.\nThe commissioner said that despite various meetings to solve the impasse, including with the Office of the Prime Minister, there seems to be no end to this problem because the Health Ministry \u201cis very reluctant to take any action\u201d.\nInsisting that the government was ignoring the Ombudsman\u2019s Office \u2013 a constitutional set-up \u2013 the Commissioner for Health accused the administration of abuse.\n\u201cThe Ministry for Health seems to be taking advantage of the fact that the Office of the Ombudsman does not have executive powers,\u201d the Commissioner said.\nIt is unacceptable that the government ignores a constitutionally-set-up body\nHealth industry sources told Times of Malta that the Health Commissioner has warned the government for many years about deficiencies in the system and has in the past even presented reports to the Office of the Prime Minister and Parliament.\n\u201cAlthough most of the problems can be attributed to bureaucracy and the lack of will by the Health Ministry, it is unacceptable that the government ignores a constitutionally-set up body over a change of protocol and rules for the past six years,\u201d the sources said.\nIn his report, the commissioner gave examples of the government\u2019s resistance to solve the simplest of recommendations.\nOne of the 2017 cases concerns the purchase of a few pairs of elastic stockings which are used to improve blood circulation to cater for the smallest and the largest of sizes, the Commissioner said.\n\u201cIt is unbelievable that after more than two years the matter is still pending,\u201d he added.\nBranded medicines\nThe issue of branded medicines is also another bone of contention which, according to the Ombudsman, the government seems to be resisting.\nWhile the government normally provides generic medicines to save costs, in the case of some exceptional cases, patients are ordered by their doctors to take branded (originals) products, as these are more effective.\nThe commissioner said that despite Health Minister Chris Fearne\u2019s public commitment to revise the protocols and start providing these type of medicines for such cases, this has not happened.\nTo solve the issue, in 2017 the Health Minister set up a committee, called the Exceptional Medical Treatment Committee, to discuss and decide on pending requests by patients.\n\u201cUnfortunately, the committee moved the goalposts with the result that the subject became the medicinal and not the patient,\u201d the commissioner observed.\nThe commissioner said this was a matter of grave concern, because \u201cunless given the appropriate treatment, patients will suffer the consequences\u201d.\nCivil service waits\nAsked on Wednesday to react to the Ombudsman's findings, principal permanent secretary Mario Cutajar said\u00a0the civil service would be analysing the report and taking action.\n\u201cWe always take action,\u201d he said, adding that

after both the Police Commissioner and Inland Revenue Commissioner said they were short of staff to assign full-time officers to work with the unit.\nWriting in the ARB\u2019s first annual report, chairman Joseph Camilleri highlights how regulations setting up the bureau envisioned key roles within the bureau being occupied by experienced staff nominated by the police and Inland Revenue Department.\nMr Justice Emeritus Camilleri said the lack of staff availability from these two entities was \u201cquite a big set-back for the setting up of a well-functioning ARB equipped with already skilled officers, as envisaged by the ARB regulations\u201d.\nCriminal asset recovery is a vital plank in the fight against organised crime.\nThe judge said the regulations setting up the ARB had foreseen that the police nominated to work at the bureau would be pivotal for the investigative aspect of its work.\nOfficers from the Inland Revenue Department were likewise expected to provide the bureau with the necessary auditing and accounting skills.\nHe said the \u201cunexpected development\u201d obviously represented a significant shift away from the regulations setting up the bureau.\nInstead, they each accepted and appointed a liaison officer to assist the ARB when needed and a plan was agreed as to the way forward, the annual report says.\nThe report charts how the ARB had to move ahead without the support of this expected readily available technical expertise, by recruiting staff from elsewhere and providing them with specialised training.\nThe former judge did find some solace in the lack of trained staff made available to him by the police and Inland Revenue, saying this further ensured the bureau\u2019s independence.\n\u2018Serious shortcomings in asset recovery regime\u2019\nTimes of Malta previously reported how the bureau spent years in limbo after the Justice Ministry failed to give it the necessary legal tools to function. Judge Emeritus Camilleri confirmed as much in the annual report, stating the legal notice giving birth to the bureau was published in 2015, but the regulations were not bought into force immediately and \u201cpractically remained inoperative for about two years\u201d.\nThe first members of the bureau\u2019s board were appointed in November 2015, and a new board was appointed in 2017.\nRELATED STORIESBureau recovers \u20ac2,760 in criminal assetsOffice took three years to set up\n\u201cThe task of building the ARB from scratch fell on the shoulders of the current board as composed and chaired,\u201d the annual report says.\nConfiscation of criminal assets has long been identified as a major lacuna in Malta\u2019s arsenal against organised crime.\nThe ARB\u2019s annual report highlights how court judgments ordering the confiscation of assets were often futile, as the confiscation regime has \u201csome serious shortcomings which need to be addressed\u201d.\nLast year, the bulk of assets recovered by the bureau were movable ones like bank accounts, cars and boats.\nThe remaining 17 per cent were related to immovable assets.", "comment_count": 3, "id": 1983}, {"keywords": "Technology", "author": "Philip Leone Ganado", "article_body": "Malta ranks among the bottom quarter of EU countries for broadband speeds, according to a new worldwide test.

I relied on what he told me.\u201d\n'Delusions of grandeur'\nDr Cassar said that on the basis of what the patient had recounted during that interview, coupled with his psychiatric file, including a note by another psychiatrist who had commented earlier that Mr Emmanuel had \u201csome delusions of grandeur\u201d and was \u201cparanoidal towards his partner,\u201d he had concluded that the man was acutely psychotic.\nA delusion was a \u201cfixed, false belief,\u201d Dr Cassar explained. In this case, Mr Emmanuel, who also claimed that God had spoken to him at a younger age when he still lived in his African village, believed that his partner Maria Lourdes had a bad omen which she asked him to remove.\nWhat he told me convinced me that he was delusional- Psychiatrist after examining the accused\nAfter \u201cremoving\u201d the omen, the man had told the psychiatrist how he had placed a crucifix upon her as though to bless her.\n\u201cI put the cross on her neck at 4.00am and I felt shock and again the cross shook,\u201d the man had told Dr Cassar.\n\u201cWhat he told me convinced me that he was delusional.

With an ever-increasing life expectancy and the issues that come with a decaying skeleton, the number of interventions is on the increase.\nApart from this, patients experience bone defects \u2013 like fractures and losses to the bone - following certain surgeries and traumatic experiences. This is why orthopaedic surgeons are constantly looking for improved medical implants for the treatment of bone repair, the University of Malta said.\nBone scaffolds are porous implants that are used to fill significantly large defects. While the currently available solutions are suitable when implanted in non-load bearing areas, like the face, using a stronger material could result in a more attractive option when filling defects in load-bearing areas, like the bones found in legs.\nDespite the fact that ceramic scaffolds are widely used, their tendency to break due to their brittle nature, has made them inadequate for use in bones that are subjected to sudden loading, while polymeric scaffolds lack the mechanical strength to be used in load-bearing applications. Metals, on the other hand, have the potential to exhibit the perfect balance between strength and toughness.\nWhat\u2019s the project all about?\nThe BioSA scaffold is being designed such that it corrodes at a controlled rate within the body, to match the rate at which the bone is healing. This aspect could result in reducing the necessity of a second surgical intervention to remove the implant after the bone has healed, the University said.\n\"The BioSA team is focused on understanding the corrosion behaviour of such an implant while also studying the effect that such an implant has on cells found in the bone. Through an innovative processing technique, based on the use of metal powders, the team also aims to gain control over the shape of the final scaffold. Accidents can happen to everyone and defects can be bigger than the body can heal naturally.

He brought about the suspension of the compilation of evidence in April after pleading legal insanity.\nThe plea was however contested by the Attorney General leading to the start of a trial on Monday morning wherein eleven ordinary citizens, seven women and four men, were empanelled to decide upon the issue.\nThe murder took place in their Paola apartment in September.\u00a0\n\u201cThe prosecution is not here capriciously. We are contesting his plea of insanity. You are here to serve justice, to do justice with the people, with the lady who has no voice here,\u201d Charles Mercieca from the Attorney General\u2019s Office said, in his introductory address to the jury.\nYou have to determine whether he was sane at the time when he strangled his partner, not before, not after, not now.\n\u201cWe are saying that he was indeed sane at the time he took her life. You have to determine whether he was sane at the time when he strangled his partner, not before, not after, not now. When he was alone in that room, he knew what he was doing, he knew the consequences of his action. The voice of Maria Lourdes can only be heard through witnesses,\u201d Dr Mercieca went on.\nThe victim\u2019s lifeless body was discovered by the police in her bedroom, seemingly asleep, shortly after her partner had turned up at the local police station early on September 15 to report that the woman could not be roused from her sleep.\nRELATED STORIESOutraged activists plan rally following woman's murder\n\u201cOne can be medically but not legally insane. In a court of law, insanity is the loss of capacity of understanding and knowing the difference between right and wrong,\u201d explained Dr Mercieca, touching upon the issues which the jury would be called upon to assess.\n\u201cMaria Lourdes Agius was not in a relationship with a mad man, she did not bear children with a mad man. He knew the consequences of his actions. He knew that it was cold, calculated murder. At that fateful point on that night he took a decision which brought us all here today. He had time after the murder to mull over what he had done. He waited until dawn to report to the police,\u201d argued the prosecuting lawyer, before giving way to the first witness.\nHe knew the consequences of his actions. He knew that it was cold, calculated murder.- Prosecution\nInspector Sarah Zerafa, stationed at the Paola police station at the time of the alleged murder, recalled how the woman had been lying on her right side on the bed, facing the wall, one arm covering her face and neck.\nAt first glance, a forensic doctor had said that the woman appeared to have died a natural death. However, when her arm was pulled down, the scratches around her mouth and marks on her neck indicated otherwise, the inspector explained.\nThe police officer had later been present at the autopsy where the cause of death was determined as asphyxia due to pressure on the neck.\nYet, later at the interrogation, the victim\u2019s partner and prime suspect, repeatedly denied having killed the woman, insisting, \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d over and over when asked about the injuries found on the victim\u2019s body.\nVictim's mother gives evidence, describes the deteriorating relationship\nThe victim's mother, Mary Agius, who used to live with the couple in Paola, described the deteriorating relationship and various violent episodes when she gave evidence on Monday afternoon.\u00a0\n\u201cIf he was unhappy with her, he ought to have taken his children and moved out. Your children are your flesh and blood, my daughter was my own flesh and blood. I forgive you but\u2026..\u201d said the visibly agitated woman, as she turned to face the accused, clutching Maria Lourdes\u2019 memorial card closely to her chest, her trembling voice occasionally giving way to tears.\nThe widow recalled, sometimes pausing briefly looking down at her daughter\u2019s picture, how the couple had at first lived at a rented Qawra flat before moving to the family apartment at Paola where the alleged murder took place.\nHer daughter \u201chad suffered much throughout her life, always trying to find a father for her children,\u201d the mother explained, saying that her daughter had borne seven children, fathered by five men, the accused having fathered two.\n\u201cMike\u201d (the accused) was a good parent who helped with caring for the three kids who lived with the couple. He had a job as a plasterer and was intent on acquiring the Paola apartment where he was carrying out works, the mother said.\nHowever, the couple\u2019s relationship had degenerated, particularly over the last year, when violent arguments frequently erupted mostly over money matters and the fact that Lourdes\u2019 former partner would sometimes visit his child at the Paola flat.\n\u201cI would advise her not to let other men into the flat. I was afraid of men fighting,\u201d the fragile-looking witness recalled.\n\u201cMike\u201d also lost his temper when her daughter would use money to do her hair and nails, the witness said. \u201cHe always insisted that we should first buy things for the children and then for the house.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you going to give the children?\u201d he often asked his partner\u2019s mother whom he called \u201cMa\u2019.\u201d\nDuring an incident, when the witness had stepped in during one of the couple\u2019s rows, the accused had punched her head and had flung a heavy chair at Lourdes\u2019 back, she said.\u00a0\nShe recalled her daughter telling her: On Friday it\u2019s you in an ambulance, on Saturday it will be me in a hearse.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI was angry. At the time I recalled when, few months earlier, my daughter had ended up at the ITU in critical condition after giving birth to her last child. How could he treat her so?\u201d said the mother, adding that she used to advise her daughter not to bear more children.\nAfter that incident, the accused had told her, \u201cNo dress, no shoes, out, out!\u201d kicking her out of the flat. She was taken to hospital where she had opened up to a doctor, telling him how she and her daughter were threatened.\nA police report had been filed and mother and daughter had been warned to call for help should Mr Emmanuel turn up again.\nRecalling the hours leading to the alleged murder, the witness said Michael Emmanuel did return, kicking the door of the common entrance and demanding to see his son.\nThe mother had warned her daughter not to let him in, but the latter had not taken heed and had thrown down the keys, letting him inside.\n\u201cNothing happened. Lourdes went shopping,\u201d the accused had told her when she saw him early next morning.\nSlipping past him, she had gone to the bedroom where her daughter lay still under the bedsheets. Touching the woman\u2019s thigh, she immediately sensed that she was dead. \u201cI love you,\u201d the mother had murmured.\nShe returned to the room when the police arrived some time after the accused had filed a report.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t speak to him after that. Lourdes would not be brought back to life,\u201d the mother went on.\nShe also recalled how some three weeks before, she had spotted a burnt doll on the kitchen roof and found a lit candle in the stairwell, thinking it was for her husband who had passed away but later suspecting that it might have had Ouija board implications.\nPriest's warning\nWhen confiding in a priest, he had told her, \u201cTell Lourdes to come to me at once. That\u2019s a sign that he\u2019s going to kill her or you.\u201d\nHowever her daughter had not heeded her advice. \u201cPerhaps none of this would have happened had she done so.\u201d\nUnder cross-examination the woman said that she had not told the police at first that she had already entered the bedroom alone.\nShe also said that she had discovered three of her daughter\u2019s teeth under a bedside carpet after the police had left.\nOne juror asked her what she understood by \u2018ouija board,\u2019 to which the woman replied, \u201cSomeone is going to kill you.\u201d\nThe victim\u2019s brother brought Monday\u2019s afternoon session to a close saying that he had once argued with the accused and had called the police. He had immediately \u201csensed,\u201d that the man was not ideal for his sister but failed to explain why, even when asked directly by the court.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to cause trouble. So I stayed away. When I faced my sister about it, she had taken it badly,\u201d Mr Jean Paul Agius said.\nThe trial continues on Tuesday.\nLawyer Matthew Xuereb is also prosecuting.\nLawyers Marc Sant and Dustin Camilleri are defence counsel.", "comment_count": 0, "id": 2017}, {"keywords": "Aviation, Unions", "author": "", "article_body": "Government-owned Malta MedAir could step in and take over Air Malta\u2019s growth plan if issues between the national airline and its pilots are not resolved, Tourism Minister Konrad Mizzi said on Monday.\n\u201cWe\u2019re keeping our options open,\u201d Dr Mizzi said in a brief video statement he uploaded to Facebook.\nOne of those options, the minister suggested, was to use government-owned Malta MedAir to implement growth plans which would see Air Malta expand into long-haul flights to the Americas and Asia.\u00a0\n\u201cWe want Air Malta to grow,\u201d Dr Mizzi reiterated in his video message. \u00a0\u201cBut if it is not in a position [to do so]\u2026 the option is there.
