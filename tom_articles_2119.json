The law, he pointed out, was a means to promote higher standards of conduct in public life.\nOn staffing levels, Dr Hyzler said he was not facing any restrictions, although numbers alone were not a measure of his office\u2019s effectiveness. \u201cWhat really matters is whether cases of ethical misconduct are considered fairly, swiftly and without fear or favour,\u201d he remarked.\nAnother concern flagged by Greco was the lack of powers available to the Standards Commissioner to sanction transgressions. Greco evaluators, who visited Malta last year, said they would have expected to see more effective and dissuasive sanctions available in the Commissioner\u2019s arsenal.\nUltimately, Greco said the only sanction foreseen was for the person investigated to be admonished, unless the matter escalated to a criminal investigation because it was forwarded to the police or to the Permanent Commission Against Corruption.\nOne of its recommendations is that the Standards Commissioner is given the ap-propriate means to conduct inquiries and to propose effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions. Also, his jurisdiction should be extended to ongoing situations even when these resulted from actions that predated the enactment of the law setting up the Standards Commissioner\u2019s office.\nDr Hyzler noted that he could refer breaches of the law to Parliament\u2019s Standing Committee for Standards in Public Life, which was equally represented by government and Opposition MPs.\nIf the committee agreed with his report, it could admonish the person investigated and also demand the repayment of any public funds that could have been misused.\nThe committee could also recommend the dismissal of a person of trust, although it would be up to the government to decide whether or not to follow such recommendation, Dr Hyzler said.\nHe conceded that while admonitions or orders to apologise could be viewed as only being symbolic sanctions, viewed within the local political scene, where it was very rare for people in public life to apologise or admit they were wrong, such sanctions could be quite effective.\n\u201cAn admonition or an order to apologise for misconduct will send a powerful message that not anything goes and that such misconduct is no longer acceptable, in which case the person could pay a political price.\n\u201cI do agree that the Standards in Public Life Act could be strengthened but I also believe that even in its current state it should be a force for the raising of standards in our country,\u201d Dr Hyzler said.", "comment_count": 12, "id": 3526}, {"keywords": "", "author": "Ivan Camilleri", "article_body": "About a quarter of police officers reinstated after Labour\u2019s return to power in 2013 were allocated non-policing duties in government ministries, the Times of Malta is informed.\nPolice sources said only a handful of the over 100 officers who returned to the corps six years ago were still active in the force.\n\u201cMost of them have retired again, though receiving a much higher pension,\u201d a senior officer said.\nThe few remaining others, he continued, were doing office jobs at the police headquarters or asked to be seconded to government ministries, including as private secretaries to ministers they used to \u201chelp\u201d before the election.\nAccording to recent information given in Parliament, 119 police officers were reinstated since 2013 following a change in the rules.\nTwenty-six of them are serving in ministries though still on the police payroll.

Conversely, if the prime minister recommends dissolution of parliament (before the end of its term) and the President considers that the government can be carried on without dissolution and that dissolution would not be in the interests of Malta, he may refuse to dissolve parliament.\nThe President is a key part of the legislative process. Draft financial legislation first needs to be presented to the President who then recommends it to the House. The President also has to give his assent to all Bills approved by the House before they become law. \u00a0\nIn cases of public emergency, if the House is not in session, the President may by proclamation summon it.\nDespite this important legislative role, the President only addresses the House of Representatives upon his/her appointment and at the summoning of parliament. Only one President has addressed the summoning of parliament twice \u2013 Ugo Mifsud Bonnici did so when Alfred Sant\u2019s Labour government was elected in 1996 and when the PN government was elected 22 months later.\nAmong other roles, the President receives the diplomatic credentials of new ambassadors to Malta, chairs the Commission for the Administration of Justice and, acting on the advice of the government, appoints judges and the heads of constitutional bodies.\u00a0\nThe President may grant a pardon to convicted criminals as well as reduce or nullify court sentences, acting on the advice of the Minister of Justice.\nThe President has a right to be informed by the prime minister and ministers of all affairs of state.\nWhile judges and other holders of constitutional offices such as the Auditor-General and the Ombudsman enjoy security of tenure and cannot be removed without a two-thirds majority of the House, the President is appointed and may be removed by resolution of the House backed by a simple majority. Removal of the President can only take place on the grounds of inability to perform the functions of his office (whether arising from infirmity of body or mind or any other cause) or inappropriate behaviour.\nThe term of office the President otherwise lasts for five years. There is no second term.\u00a0\nHistory of the presidency\nThe presidency came into being on December 13, 1974 when Malta was declared a republic.\u00a0Malta's first President: Sir Anthony Mamo.\nThe first President was Sir Anthony Mamo, the only President who did not come with a political background. He was previously Chief Justice and Governor-General.\nThe other Presidents were Anton Buttigieg, Agatha Barbara, Censu Tabone, Ugo Mifsud Bonnici, Guido de Marco, Eddie Fenech Adami, George Abela and Marie-Louise Coleiro Preca.

Photo: Jonathan Borg\nIn the worst case scenario, if a cow took a turn for the worse during the night in the weekend and it was not treated immediately because of a lack of medicine or a vet, a farmer could lose the animal overnight to an infection.\nLeafing through a file containing 15-years\u2019 worth of prescriptions, he explained that every farmer was obliged to document the prescribed treatment and its administration in a herd book which was monitored by a vet.\nFor dairy farmers there is no way around compliance \u2013 the milk they produce is tested daily for quality and any residue, and a sample kept for some days to ensure traceability in case something happens.\nApart from random inspections by the veterinary authorities, the dairy cooperative and the local milk producer also carry out farm visits.\n\u201cIn order to qualify for EU funds, officials carry out cross-check compliance visits, and believe me, nowadays we cannot do without such funding.\n\u201cAt the same time, in Malta we are competing with EU products and the only way to survive is to keep our standards higher than everyone else\u2019s.\u201d Because of the island\u2019s size, breeders could not run away from inspection, while products ended up on consumers\u2019 table overnight, he said.\n\u201cWe are very careful because if one breeder commits one mistake, the whole sector will all come falling down,\u201d Mr Fenech said, noting that the average herd size in Malta was larger than that of France and Germany.\nThe academic\nWarnings of antibiotic overuse might make headlines, but\u00a0animal husbandry lecturer Paul Spiteri reckons the biggest problem is the exact opposite.\nMcast lecturer Paul Spiteri, who has also worked in poultry breeding, confirmed that the penalties were far too big for any farmer to abuse medicinal treatment.\nThe only way to survive is to keep our standards higher than everyone else\u2019s\nApart from medicine being costly, its misuse could see a breeder lose the whole stock.\nHe insisted that the proper use of antibiotics was not wrong, but rather its misuse, and more specifically underuse was detrimental as it led to resistance.\nDangers of antibiotic underuse\n\u201cUnderuse is even more dangerous than overuse. If there are still people who do this to save money it is because they are unaware that resistance \u2013 and therefore disease \u2013 could spread across the whole farm.\u201d\n\u201cIf this happens at least once on a poultry farm where chicken is grown for its meat, the breeder could lose a fifth of their annual income, as they usually have five crops a year.\u201d\nMr Spiteri has witnessed a decrease in antibiotic use. While in the past poultry used to be administered treatment \u201cjust in case\u201d, there has now been an increase in prevention methods.\nRead: Animal antibiotics being bought over the counter\nAnimal breeders were more focused on ensuring the right environment for the animals.\nWhen it comes to egg-laying poultry, antibiotics could not be administered because residues in eggs could lead to the destruction of a whole batch of thousands of eggs.\nBreeders have therefore resorted to vaccinating the chickens when they are still young, so that during their egg-laying period they do not need any antibiotics.\n\u201cIf breeders overuse antibiotics they will one way or another get caught, and if they underuse antibiotics, they would create resistance. Either way, it is very expensive for the farmer.\u201d\nThe regulator\nNew legislation will give Maltese authorities stronger teeth when it comes to veterinary medicine compliance, but in the meantime Roberto Andrea Balbo has already noticed increased biosecurity compliance by farmers.\nCurrent legislation allows some control over medicinal use within the veterinary sector that acts as a deterrent for farmers, such as the destruction of carcasses containing antibiotic residue and the culling of whole flocks.\nVeterinary Regulation Director Roberto Andrea Balbo. Photo: Jonathan Borg\nHowever, the lack of a comprehensive law means that while the authorities could take someone to court, the case could fall because of legislative gaps, Dr Balbo, Veterinary Regulation Director, explained.\nTough new laws\nSo when the EU started drafting veterinary medicine legislation which has to be fully implemented by 2022, Malta started doing its own homework.\nThe new local legislation, which should be in place later on this year, has been tailor-made to not only reflect the EU regulations, but to also cover the existing gaps.\nFor Dr Balbo, the possible misuse of medicine without a prescription is a primary concern.\n\u00a0\u201cKeeping some medicine at hand just in case there are no vets available is not the ideal approach. While there are medicines that are considered relatively safe and can be bought over the counter, there are others that could create more problems if they are consumed than if they are not.\u201d\nThe possible misuse of medicine without a prescription is a primary concern\nJust like an ill person, a sick animal \u2013 whether at home or on a farm \u2013 requires treatment, however prevention is always better than cure.\nThis included changing one\u2019s footwear or clothing to avoid spreading germs when visiting a farm, ensuring optimal storage of feed, proper ventilation within animal holds, and preventing the disease getting out of the farm.\nVaccination is also imperative, as is proper hygiene at home around pets.\nTests reveal high compliance\nFarmers, he noted, had to ensure that they were compliant with biosecurity measures if they wanted to access EU and other grants.\n\u201cWe visit all the farms in Malta more than once a year, including small units with less than 10 sheep for example as they still need to be tested,\u201d he said, adding that some inspections were unannounced.\nThere the officials test for residues of, among others, contaminants, undeclared additives, medicine, antibiotics and hormones \u2013 things that can end up in the animal and therefore in the final product. Some tests are carried out in Malta and other samples are sent abroad to accredited laboratories.\nAround 1,050 tests were carried out locally and abroad for antimicrobial residues in 2016, another 1,600 in 2017 and a further 1,600 in 2018.\nA total of five failed in 2016, another nine in 2017 and a further eight in 2018.\nThis, according to Dr Balbo, showed an extremely high degree of compliance. The authorities have meanwhile taken an active role in raising awareness about the risks involved in misuse of medicine, Dr Balbo said.\nApart from missing out on grants and compensation funds, farmers could also lose part or all of their animal stock. If a carcass tested positive for antibiotics at the slaughterhouse, the farmer would remain under continuous monitoring, while a dairy producer\u2019s whole consignment of milk could be discarded or a poultry flock culled if there were any residues.\nThe doctor\nCan remnants in animals be passed on to people? Prof. Michael Borg, Head of the Department of Infection Control, answers the worrying questions.\nProf. Michael Borg. Photo: Matthew Mirabelli\nCan remnants of antibiotics in animals be passed on to people when they consume meat or products such as dairy?\nDefinitely. If you consume animal products that contain antibiotic residues, this is just as bad as taking a dose of an antibiotic. If this happens regularly due to poor practices in animal husbandry, then the impact on human health is very real.\nCan resistance to antibiotics be passed on to people in any way?\nAgain yes. The worry is that resistant bacteria from food directly contaminate humans. To give an example... if a chicken develops resistant bacteria in its intestine as a result of inappropriate antibiotic use by the farmer, when it is slaughtered the bacteria ends up contaminating the carcass.\nWhen the chicken is processed at home, those bacteria then end up contaminating the chopping board, work surfaces and hands of whoever is preparing it. These bacteria can easily be ingested by touching the mouth or face or by cross-contaminating ready-to-eat foods \u2013 especially if the basics of food hygiene are not rigidly applied. Therefore these resistant bacteria enter the human gut and there can proliferate and render the person a carrier of these resistant microbes.\nWhat precautions should people take when preparing meat/dairy products at home, so as to avoid the transmission of antibiotics, or resistance?\nProperly cooking meat items \u2013 especially poultry and particularly on BBQs. Reach at least 75\u02daC \u2013 few people use a probe thermometer to check cooking temperatures but this should be the rule. Above all, strict food hygiene. Using separate chopping boards for raw meats from those of ready-to-eat food such as salads and cheese. Washing chopping boards used for raw meat separately and then rinsing with piping hot water to kill any microbes. Ensuring work surfaces used for raw meats are disinfected with an appropriate sanitiser after preparing raw meats and most important of all, washing hands thoroughly every time after handling raw meats.\nEating local\nThis is the third in a series of articles in The Sunday Times of Malta looking at different aspects of the local food industry in a bid to raise more awareness of this crucial, yet often neglected, sector.\nOther articles in the series:\u00a0\n1.
