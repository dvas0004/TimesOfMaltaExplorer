The federation argued that only a proper court could deliver a decision on the matter given that, in case of \u2018guilt\u2019, it could be fined up to \u20ac1.25 million.\nFollowing the judgment, the Competition Office had announced it would be refraining from imposing any fines until the situation was remedied.

It also sets fines for people caught not separating their waste, though questions about how such laws can be implemented remain. \n\nMore than 90% of our municipal waste was still going to landfill in 2017. Even more worrying, the percentage share of municipal waste being recycled was actually lower that year \u2013 8.6% - than in 2013, when 9.8% was recycled.\n\nThe vast majority of our recycling is of paper and cardboard, which until 2017 made up more than the combined totals of all other recycling categories. In 2017, metal recycling picked up steam. Other categories also improved.\nThis breakdown will also likely change in the coming years, once a bottle and beverage can refund scheme comes into effect.\n\nThe total volume of municipal waste being generated is growing year-on-year, which is to be expected as Malta\u2019s population continues to grow. What is likely to concern planners is that the amount of waste being generated per capita is also growing.\nTo put things in context, the average EU citizen generates 480kg of municipal waste every year.

6,779, visas issued between March 2014 and September 2015, were not recommended for approval by the immigration police, yet the visas were subsequently approved by the consul.\u00a0\nPolice

This forms the basis of our contacts with our Libyan brothers and sisters and of the Tunisian initiative for the settlement of the crisis in Libya, to which Algeria and Egypt have joined.\n\u201cIn this regard Tunisia and neighbouring countries are content to facilitate dialogue and encourage the Libyan people, in collaboration with the United Nations, to sit down at the negotiating table to end the crisis that is shaking the country and to the implementation of the political process.\n\u201cThe stability of Libya is sine qua non for the stability of Tunisia,\u201d he stresses.\nHe describes what is happening in the Mediterranean vis-\u00e0-vis migration as \u201ca real tragedy\u201d.\u00a0\n\u201cThousands of lives lost in the waters of our Mare Nostrum is not acceptable and we border countries and beyond have a role to play is tackling this issue.\u201d\nPresident Essebsi says Tunisia is making a great effort to combat illegal migration and to protect and control its land and sea borders.\n\u201cA tremendous effort by the security apparatus is deployed to prevent the departure of makeshift boats. The efforts of the security forces have made it possible to frustrate several attempts at illegal emigration and to arrest several inter-mediaries and members of trafficking networks.\u201d\nHe says that an important law was passed in Tunisia specifically aimed at preventing the trafficking of persons and a National Anti-Trafficking Body has been set up within the Ministry of Justice.\nTunisia, the President says, believes that migration needs to be addressed as part of a comprehensive approach that tackles the root causes of irregular migration and focuses, in particular, on the development of regions with high migration potential.\nWe think there is a niche for the Maltese private sector for the recruitment of skilled and qualified Tunisian youths\n\u201cWe should be guided by the need of solidarity with the countries of origin,\u201d he says, adding that this should be combined with making more of an effort at stabilising Libya and facilitating a political settlement under the aegis of the UN.\nAsked why Tunisia is the only success story of the Arab Spring, and how feasible is it for democracy and real political reform to spread to other Arab countries, President Essebsi replies: \u201cThere is no such thing as an \u2018Arab Spring!\u2019 There could be a beginning of a Tunisian Spring in the aftermath of January 11, 2011.\u201d\nHe adds: \u201cWe in Tunisia have the irrevocable political will to continue on the road to democracy and the establishment of constitutional institutions guaranteeing fundamental freedoms and the rule of law, but we have no intention to export this experience to anywhere else in the world. Those who are interested are most welcome to look at our achievements.\u201d\nTunisia has progressed well politically but still faces a number of challenges on the economic front. Does he believe the international community can do more to help Tunisia\u2019s economy?\n\u201cOur major challenges, for which we are called upon to provide urgent solutions, include unemployment, especially young graduates, regional socio-economic imbalances, social demands as well as security challenges. In this \u2018Global Village\u2019 nobody is able independently to find the proper solution, and looking at what could be the consequences of Tunisia failing on the way to its transition, I do believe there is much at stake for the international community in enhancing its commitments to my country.\u201d\nAlthough the security situation since the 2015 terror attacks seems to have improved, Tunisia still faces attacks from Islamist militants and Isis-affiliated groups. Is Tunisia capable of defeating these terrorists?\n\u201cYes we are. I am reinforced in my conviction by the many successes we have achieved thanks to the unwavering commitment of our security forces,\u201d he says.\n\u201cViolence, obscurantism and extremism are all plagues we must fight together, and we must be more vigilant so that our younger generations are not attracted to radicalism. Hence the need for the implementation of a preventive approach.\n\u201cTunisia has adopted a national strategy, an organic law that led to the creation of a National Commission for the Prevention and Fight against Violent Extremism and Terrorism. An action plan is being developed.\u201d\nRegarding Tunisia\u2019s position on Syria and whether there can be a future for the country with Bashar al-Assad as President, Mr Essebsi says his country\u2019s position is based on the principle of giving the highest priority to the preservation of the Syrian State and the security and stability of its people.\n\u201cThe way to achieve all this is an urgent and comprehensive political settlement that brings together all factions and components of the Syrian people except terrorist groups,\u201d he says.\n\u201cOur country supports the political negotiations aimed at finding a way out of the crisis away from bias towards any party as the regime in Syria remains an internal sovereign matter for the Syrian people.\n\u201cThe Tunisian diplomacy\u2019s priority is currently to focus on continuing efforts in various regional and international fora to push for a political settlement in this brotherly country.\u201d\nBeji Caid Essebsi is the founder of the Nidaa Tounes (Call of Tunisia) political party, a secular centrist party which won a plurality of seats in the October 2014 parliamentary election.\nIn December 2014, he won the first regular presidential election following the Tunisian Revolution, becoming Tunisia\u2019s first freely and directly elected president. The Tunisian President is directly responsible for foreign and defence policy.\nMr Essebsi previously served as Foreign Minister from 1981 to 1986 and as Prime Minister from February 2011 to December 2011.", "comment_count": 7, "id": 99}]
