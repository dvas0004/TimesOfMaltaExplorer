I hear this sort of thing on a daily basis. It is almost funny, except that it is sad,\u201d Mr Lupi Spencer says.\nThe young amateur farmer blames this lack of basic knowledge on a system that is failing to equip students with practical information about our culture and indigenous industries.\n\u201cI do remember being taught an amount of practical information when I was still at school. We were taught simple cooking using local ingredients, how to grow tomatoes and herbs at home... that sort of thing.\n\u201cThe idea was not to turn us all into farmers, of course, but to foster an appreciation of the agricultural process. This has all been lost today,\u201d he says.\nMr Lupi Spencer also laments the readiness to import and buy produce from nearby countries like Sicily, which places an added strain on the flailing local industry.\n\u201cIt is a shame to see that so many automatically gravitate towards imported fruit and vegetables, with many not even being aware that when fruit travels a certain distance it loses a percentage of its nutrients and even taste. The produce with the least footprint tends to be the healthier, cheaper and more delicious.\u201d\nMeanwhile Mr Lupi Spencer, together with a number of others, is doing his bit to support the industry through the Facebook Dilettanti group. It provides what he describes as a space for like-minded individuals to network and to exchange knowledge, whether they are full-time, part-time or even amateur farmers or gardeners.\nThe encouraging feedback has led to the birth of a sister Facebook page called Ixtri Online Ming\u0127and Il-Bidwi Dirett. The public group offers a platform for those who grow their own produce to sell it directly to the consumer without the need of a middleman.\n\u201cThe problem of lack of transparency at the pitkalija persists,\u201d Mr Lupi Spencer says. \u201cThis page is directly aimed towards eliminating the commercial and financial problems that the pitkali middleman system is creating for farmers.\n\u201cOnly last week, I was told of an incident where an entire truck of beautiful, fresh lettuce was sold for a ridiculous price. It\u2019s obvious that a better-regulated system is needed if farmers are to survive.\u201d\nHe adds that \u201ceveryone\u201d is aware of the specific problems that beseige the farming industry, but \u201cno-one wants to actually do something about them\u201d.\nIxtri Online Ming\u0127and Il-Bidwi Dirett seems set to redress the situation somewhat, having attracted a healthy number of regulars from both sides of the fence.\nA cursory scroll through the page reveals a wealth of local seasonal produce that ranges from potatoes to onions, marrows, strawberries, carrots, broccoli, oranges, cabbages and more.\nThe platform is open to all forms of produce, including eggs, honey, marmalades and jams, and even the ever popular limoncello liqueur.\nRead: 'L-A\u0127\u0127ar Bidwi' could be a reality in just 15 years\u00a0\n\u201cIt is immediately evident that neither supply nor demand are lacking, and that all that is needed is an efficient and fair system,\u201d Mr Lupi Spencer says. \u201cBut, of course, the problem needs to be tackled at source by the authorities.\u201d\nThe lobbyist puts the success of the initiative down to what he describes as \u201cfostering personal connections\u201d.\n\u201cIt helps when people build a working relationship, and they know who they are dealing with. It\u2019s the kind of atmosphere that encourages return clients,\u201d he explains.\nThe page is peppered with colourful and enticing photos of produce, leaving no doubt in the mind of a potential customer about the quality on offer.\nAn added convenience that has also met with success is that some of the farmers offer deliveries to homes.\n\u201cThe will is there on both sides. Given education and proper regulation, the farming industry does not need to die out,\u201d Mr Lupi Spencer concluded.\nThis is the second in a series of articles looking at different aspects of the local food industry.\u00a0\nRead the first article.\u00a0", "comment_count": 23, "id": 2719}, {"keywords": "", "author": "Keith Micallef", "article_body": "A Yemeni man paid a hefty price for not declaring \u20ac14,000 he was carrying while transiting through Malta International Airport, as he ended up losing half of this sum to the Maltese authorities.\nMohammed Abdullah Ahmed Al-Wahaishi, 55, was arrested on Friday evening at Malta International Airport prior to boarding a Turkish Airlines flight to Istanbul on his way to Saudi Arabia, where he resides.\nPolice inspector Keith Vella told the court that the cash, which was found by customs officials in the defendant\u2019s bag, comprised different denominations, though the bulk was in the form of 50,000 Saudi riyals (\u20ac11,800).\u00a0\nFacing duty Magistrate Aaron Bugeja, the man pleaded guilty and apologised, insisting that this was a genuine mistake.

Dr Delia had vehemently denied any wrongdoing.\nAddressing Labour Party supporters at Marsascala on Sunday morning, Dr Muscat said that while he would not get into the allegations that Dr Delia faced, insisting he would wait until investigations were concluded to comment, he urged the Opposition leader to go to a magistrate and request an investigation into the claims.\n\u201cWe are not like those who protested in the streets in an attempt to destabilise the country. We have always been consistent on this and so we will judge the Opposition leader when the investigations are concluded.

So people could see the connection...today, people find water in abundance in the tap, whatever the weather.\u201d\nA case of too much of a good thing?\nRipping up the rulebook\nYou can hardly blame developers for ignoring the rules if authorities do it too.

We opened inquiries into the report\u2019s findings. However at this point it depends largely on other jurisdictions \u2013 some of which are very secretive \u2013 handing over the necessary information, as well as probing a 15-year-old prostitution racket which allegedly operated in another country,\u201d the source said.\u00a0\nFour months ago The Sunday Times of Malta reported how a London-based prostitution racket and the alleged involvement of Dr Delia were part of an ongoing money-laundering investigation by the police.\nThe allegations against Dr Delia, which date back to the period between 2001 and 2004, had first been reported by the late Daphne Caruana Galizia, about two months before she was killed in a car bomb explosion outside her Bidnija home.\nDr Delia has vehemently denied any wrongdoing and insists his involvement was limited to that of a legal advisor and representative for other Maltese nationals involved.\u00a0\nThe Sunday Times of Malta has now learnt that the 30-page FIAU report details how the FIAU had received corroborating information around the time Ms Caruana Galizia\u2019s had first exposed the matter on her website Running Commentary back in 2017.\u00a0\nWhat the FIAU found on Adrian Delia\nA tip-off received by the FIAU in 2017 indicated that a Barclays account in Jersey owned by Dr Delia could have been associated with a Soho prostitution racket and used to launder illicit gains.\nThe Sunday Times of Malta can confirm that the FIAU then conducted an in-depth analysis of Dr Delia\u2019s offshore Jersey account, gathering information from several jurisdictions, including Malta, the UK, Switzerland, the Bahamas, the British Virgin Islands and the Marshall Islands.\u00a0\nIn a nutshell, the unit found that Dr Delia\u2019s account \u2013 which he has repeatedly denied having any recollection of \u2013 was opened in February 2001 and closed in October 2004.\u00a0\nGraphic: Design Studio\nWhile it was open, some \u00a3346,000 (around half a million euros) were deposited into the Jersey account in the form of varying cash and cheques which were made directly through branches around London, predominantly the Edgware Road branch, but also via a number of other locations.\nIt was this activity, together with Ms Caruana Galizia\u2019s reporting, which prompted the FIAU to look a little deeper.\u00a0\nRead: Delia claims his signature has been forged\nIt remains unclear exactly what happened between the years 2001 and 2004. However, FIAU investigators believe two Maltese nationals, Emanuel and Eve Bajada, were involved in a dispute over money that was supposedly deposited in Dr Delia\u2019s Barclays Jersey account for the benefit of two mysterious companies \u2013 Healey Properties Ltd and AAS Freight Services Ltd \u2013 believed to be owned by their relatives, Eucharist and Mary Bajada.\nEmanuel and his son Victor Bajada were in 2005 accused of human trafficking and running a brothel in Malta. Emanuel pleaded guilty and his sentence was later confirmed by the Criminal Court of Appeal in September 2016. He was also separately charged with money laundering on the same case and found guilty.\nMs Caruana Galizia\u2019s allegations that Emanuel and Eve Bajada deposited funds into Dr Delia\u2019s Barclays account in Jersey were confirmed through account statements made available to the FIAU investigators.\nThe amounts deposited, however, were not \u00a320,000 per month as had been reported by Ms Caruana Galizia but mostly varied from \u00a3400 to \u00a316,000 per deposit (an average of \u00a313,000 per deposit).\nIt was this revelation \u2013 that the deposits into Dr Delia\u2019s account were not fixed monthly rates and were therefore not believed to have been rent payments \u2013 which is considered one of the main revelations of the FIAU probe.\nThe average amount deposited was also believed to be too high to be a rent payment in the early 2000s.\nMost of the money deposited into Dr Delia\u2019s Jersey account was in cash or cheques and came from branches around the Soho area \u2013 which is known to be linked to prostitution and brothels.\u00a0\nDr Delia\u2019s Jersey account and Healey Properties Ltd\u2019s bank accounts with Bank of Valletta shared the same Birkirkara address.\nAll the transactions in and out of the account appeared to be linked with the Bajadas and the properties supposedly owned by Healey Properties and AAS Freight Services Ltd.\nThe Swiss connection and BOV\nMoney from Dr Delia\u2019s Jersey account was sent to two mystery Swiss bank accounts.\nAround \u00a3158,000 was transferred to one Swiss Barclays account across eight payments, however it was unclear who owned this account and why the money was moved there.\nThe investigators found that another \u00a360,000 was transferred to a separate Swiss Barclays account in two payments. Intelligence gathered by investigators suggests that this money was then moved on to a certain Roxanne Arlettaz, believed to be a Swiss fund manager. However at that stage the trail goes cold and it remains unclear where this money moved next.\nInvestigators meanwhile found that other funds from Dr Delia\u2019s Jersey account were also transferred to Bank of Valletta accounts held by Healey Properties Ltd.\nThe company held eight BOV accounts and investigators do not exclude that it also held other bank accounts in more secretive jurisdictions.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe funds from Dr Delia\u2019s Jersey account were then transferred from Healey Properties Ltd\u2019s Sterling account held with BOV to the company\u2019s Maltese Lira accounts at the same bank.\nA number of cheques totalling Lm106,200 (roughly a quarter of a million euro) were then issued in favour of beneficiaries who are related to Eucharist Bajada (senior), Eucharist Bajada (junior) known as Kris, and Dr Delia.\u00a0\nAlthough the FIAU concluded that Dr Delia and his bank account in Jersey may have been used for money laundering, it pointed out that due to the sensitivity of the case it had limited its requests for information.\nThis, sources informed The Sunday Times of Malta, was because of the risk of politicians being alerted to their inquiries.\nThe fallout and Dr Delia\u2019s side of the story\nDr Delia has consistently denied any allegation of wrongdoing, and on Saturday called a press conference in which he said that a number of documents related to financial transactions with his signature on them had been forged.\u00a0\nThe PN leader\u00a0said he had been made aware of the alleged forgeries after receiving questions about the FIAU investigation from The Sunday Times of Malta.\nThe Soho matter had been raised by the PN\u2019s ethics committee, which had been given 48 hours to probe the allegations, during the party\u2019s 2017 leadership race.\nIn its conclusions, the committee noted that Dr Delia had not given an explanation on certain \u201cunverified and pending issues\u201d related to the Jersey account, particularly its use, scope and the legality of the source of the funds.\nFor this reason, the PN administrative council had called on Dr Delia to consider withdrawing from the contest.\nSince then, Dr Delia has gone on record to insist he knew nothing about the bank account in Jersey.\nHe had said he did not remember ever having a Barclays account in Jersey he said he was not able to exclude this possibility entirely.\u00a0\nAt the time Ms Caruana Galizia had published a document supposedly proving the existence of his jersey account, Dr Delia had phoned Barclays International\u2019s call centre late at night to enquire about the matter.\nAccording to a recording of this call, which had been made available to The Sunday Times of Malta, no record of such an account was found.\nPeople involved in the case:\nThe Sunday Times of Malta is informed that the people investigated were Adrian Delia, Eucharist Bajada, Eucharist Jr. Bajada, Mary Bajada, Emmanuel Bajada, and Eve Patricia Bajada.\nHealey Properties Ltd, incorporated in the Bahamas back in 1999, was also indicated in the investigation. According to the company\u2019s BOV accounts, Healey Ltd was registered at Aladan, Triq Karm Zerafa, and Birkirkara. It is believed to be owned by Eucharist and Mary Bajada.\nAnother company owned by the two Bajadas, AAS Freight Services Ltd, incorporated in Marshall Islands, was also a part of the investigation.\nMoney in and money out of Dr Delia\u2019s account\nInformation obtained from the FIU in Jersey showed that between 2001 and 2004 the following funds were deposited in Dr Delia\u2019s Jersey account:\n\n\u00a3331,000 from Healey Properties (Believed to be owned by Eucharist and Mary Bajada)\n\u00a3146,000 from \u2018Edgware Road\u2019 in 18 separate payments\n\u00a356,000 from \u2018EJ Beckett\u2019 in 10 different deposits\n\u00a334,728 from \u2018Soho Square\u2019 in seven separate deposits\n\u00a330,964 from \u2018Eve Bajada\u2019 across six deposits\n\nFunds remitted from Dr Delia\u2019s Jersey account:\n\n\u00a3158,000 to a Swiss Barclays Bank account across eight payments\n\u00a391,568 to Healey Properties Ltd across seven payments\n\u00a360,000 to another Swiss Barclays Bank account across two payments.Intelligence gathered by investigators suggests that this money was then moved on to a certain Roxanne Arlettaz who is believed to be a Swiss fund manager\n\u00a340,000 to \u2018E&M Bajada\u2019 across two payments into two separate Jersey accounts\n\nThe two accounts were held by Eucharist Bajada and Mary Bajada and date back to the 1990s.

A quick look around the home or during social events confirms how often children spend time on such devices.\nA variety of terms such as \u2018digital natives\u2019, \u2018digikids\u2019 and \u2018screenagers\u2019 are constantly used to describe today\u2019s children. A recent study which I conducted has shown the extent to which children are exposed to digital technologies on a daily basis. A good number of children as young as seven have access to their own personal devices such as a mobile phone and tablet.\nIt goes without saying that reading and writing are changing with the influx of new information and communication technologies. My doctoral study showed that definitions of reading and writing now include physical interactions with texts.\nChildren are nowadays observed scrolling, touching and swiping while reading. This was evident through numerous observations conducted during the \u2018One Tablet per Child Pilot Project\u2019. The observations showed that when students read and write through the media of digital technology they interact, collaborate and communicate more among themselves.\nToday\u2019s children are engaging in skim reading, viewing, reading of images and symbols, multi-directional reading as well as audio reading\nReading in the 21st century entails the use of a variety of skills. Today\u2019s children are engaging in skim reading, viewing, reading of images and symbols, multi-directional reading as well as audio reading.\nWhat it means to be a writer is also changing, with students claiming that digital technology promotes and distinguishes between \u2018formal\u2019 and \u2018informal\u2019 writing.\nA child would, for example, write in a short, abbreviated form while chatting with a group of friends and write skilfully when working on homework tasks. This shows that children nowadays are aware of \u2018proficiency judgement\u2019 and adapt their writings according to the audience reading their work.\nThis suggests that students are learning to respond differently when they are asked to carry out written tasks on screen as opposed to paper-based resources.\nChildren\u2019s writing on screen is moving from the production of printed text towards a more complex notion of \u2018design\u2019. They are nowadays sharing information through various modes and methods, such as recorded speech and videos, photos, screenshots and also through collaborating on virtual walls.\nChildren have further showed that reading and writing on screen proves to be more fun and stimulating as these seem to be directly linked to multimedia features. It can therefore be argued that educators as well as parents need to fully acknowledge how processes of children\u2019s reading and writing are changing in the digital age.\nAs a mother myself I form part of numerous groups on social media related to children\u2019s upbringing and education and I feel that a lot of weight is constantly given to the downsides of technology. But I believe there are numerous advantages when children are diligently exposed to reading and writing on screen but this is only appreciated through an understanding of what reading and writing are coming to mean.\nIt is only through such an understanding that children will be supported and encouraged in their reading and writing skills to reach their full potential as they academically grow in the 21st century.\nMelanie Darmanin is a senior lecturer at the Malta College of Arts, Science and Technology (Mcast)\u2019s Institute of Community Services, Paola.
