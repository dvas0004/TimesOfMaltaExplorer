[{"keywords": "", "author": "Anthony Manduca", "article_body": "President George Vella has expressed his grave concern at the unfolding situation in Libya where forces loyal to General Khalifa Haftar are attempting to take control of the capital Tripoli, the seat of the UN-recognised government.\nGeorge Vella\nGeneral Haftar backs a rival administration in eastern Libya.\n\u201cI am very worried about Libya for a number of reasons. First of all the situation shows the hypocrisy of the international community which seems content to just look the other way as fighting engulfs the country. Secondly this latest conflict is certainly not in the interest of Libya, and has already led to a large number of casualties. We need to emphasise that the only way forward in Libya is a political solution.\n\u201cAnd thirdly, Malta could well be flooded by refugees if the war gets out of control and leads to a humanitarian disaster,\u201d Dr Vella told The Sunday Times of Malta.\n\n\nDr Vella said he was not surprised by General Haftar\u2019s attempt to take the Libyan capital: \u201cWe always suspected that General Haftar wanted to seize Tripoli, which he might be able to do if he buys the loyalty of the militias supporting the government of Fayez al-Sarraj. However, Misurata, which also supports the UN-backed government in Tripoli, is a different case. Misurata has a huge standing army and if Haftar tries to take control, there is potential for a bloodbath.\u201d\nThe President said that the military in Misurata had contributed a lot to the defeat of al-Qaeda and Isis in Libya, and had cleared Sirte of Isis. Many in Misurta identified with the Muslim Brotherhood and were moderate Sunni Muslims, he said, but General Haftar, who cleared eastern Libya of Islamists, had wrongly grouped the Brotherhood and other moderate Muslim groups together with the jihadists.\nDr Vella said the tragedy of Libya was that most countries were only concerned with their direct interests, and did not seem worried about the fact that so many innocent people were being killed.\nGeneral Haftar is openly backed by Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, who consider him a bulwark against Islamists. On Monday US President Donald Trump praised General Haftar during a telephone conversation, signalling Washington\u2019s support for him, and there have been a number of press reports indicating that France is secretly backing Haftar. The UN-backed government in Tripoli is supported by Turkey and Qatar.\nThe President added: \u201cUnfortunately both the UN and the EU seem to be divided over how to respond to the Libyan crisis. Last Thursday the US and Russia opposed a British bid at the UN Security Council to demand a ceasefire in Libya.\n\u201cEU foreign policy chief Federica Morgherini has tried hard to reach a consensus position to be able to arrive at a council conclusion on the matter, however, unless you have the approval of all member states you cannot take a major foreign policy decision in the EU.\u201d\nDr Vella said that realistically, Malta could only \u201cstand up and speak\u201d about Libya and exert \u201cmoral pressure\u201d on the international community to do something about the situation before it spirals out of control.\n\u201cI just want Libya to be a normal country which embarks on a transition to democracy where people can enjoy a normal and peaceful life.

This represents the operating profit before restructuring costs and non-recurring items. Tourism Minister Konrad Mizzi, whose portfolio includes Air Malta, touted this as a \u201csuccess story\u201d coming after nearly two decades of yearly losses. He did not give the financial statements to the press.\nThe figures just published, however, show that were it not for a nearly \u20ac34 million in revenue from the disposal of landing rights in 2018, the airline would have registered a loss of \u20ac17 million (after restructuring costs and non-recurring items). This would have been larger than the loss recorded in the previous year, which had reached nearly \u20ac14 million.\nCiting the most recent data available to the company up until its AGM held last month, the airline said it \u201cwill most likely register operating losses from continuing operations during the 2019 financial year\u201d.\nAccording to the airline, the losses will be due to \u201cstart-up investment in new routes, operational disruptions emanating from industrial relations issues, market volatility in respect of fuel prices, developments in the outcome of the fleet renewal process and long outstanding technology upgrades\u201d.\nThe one-time gain of \u20ac33.9 million in 2018 came from the selling of the so-called \u201csummer slots\u201d at Heathrow and Gatwick airports. The company will be using another \u20ac22.8 million gain from the sale of more landing rights \u2013 described as \u2018winter slots\u2019 \u2013 to boost its accounts in the next financial reporting period (March 2019).\nDr Mizzi did not reply to a specific question from The Sunday Times of Malta asking him to explain how Air Malta was now predicting further losses in 2019 when he had declared the airline had \u201cturned the page\u201d under his stewardship.\nRevenue up, but question marks remain\nThe March 2018 accounts show a marked general improvement in revenue generated by the airline, particularly through the reversal of a previous policy under which Air Malta\u2019s operations were shrunk during the first Labour administration. The airline has instead carried more passengers, flown more routes and re-opened others.\nHowever, industry experts have pointed to a number of technical aspects from the latest set of accounts which they suspect were the result of \u201cpotentially creative accounting techniques\u201d.\nThe company\u2019s accounts, for example, show that it spent less on fuel and maintenance costs on its planes. But industry sources pointed out that these cost decreases included in the accounts raised eyebrows because \u201cit is quite difficult to fly more and reduce your fuel costs\u201d.\nIt is quite difficult to fly more and reduce your fuel costs\nThe accounts also show savings were made through favourable foreign exchange rates. However, although this is not normally considered an operational item, it was included as such in the accounts.\nAlso, despite having undergone a restructuring exercise that included shedding staff through voluntary early retirement schemes, the size of the payroll remained nearly the same as in the previous year.\nOne industry source remarked that since Air Malta\u2019s fleet is now quite old, \u201clogic dictates that costs on maintenance should be higher and not \u20ac6 million lower as indicated in the accounts.\n\u201cHowever, some foreign exchange and playing with the window when maintenance is carried out on planes to shift costs to another year could have played a part,\u201d the source said.\nAir Malta has been struggling for several years, particularly due to cut-throat competition from low-cost airlines which have changed the way airlines conduct their business globally. The government had injected a total of \u20ac130 million into the airline during a five-year restructuring programme between 2011 and 2016, yet more losses appear to be on the horizon.\nQuestions sent to Tourism Minster Konrad Mizzi on the financial results:\n1. Can you explain how despite the significant impact of over \u20ac18m in restructuring costs, the payroll cost to Air Malta remained practically unchanged? How has the airline\u2019s staff decreased only by a mere 12 members?\n2. If the airline has effected more flights and opened new routes, how can you explain that it had a lower fuel bill?\n3. Can you explain why the company has spent less on aircraft maintenance, particularly in the light of the age of the fleet?\n4. You had indicated that the company was on track towards a profitable future. How come the financial statements indicate that Air Malta will once again register operational losses in the financial year ending March 2019? Doesn\u2019t this indicate a misleading assessment from your end of the 2018 results?\n5. Can you explain why directors\u2019 fees have doubled from \u20ac53,000 to \u20ac113,000?\nReply from Minister Mizzi:\n\u201cAs at March 2018, the restructuring process was in the initial stages and the staff turnover was expected to start in the subsequent financial year. As at March 2018 the company raised a valid expectation in employees in carrying a restructuring and recognised the non-recurring cost in the profit and loss during the reporting period.\nThe restructuring cost is a non-recurring event and will reap benefits in the subsequent years. The underlying business for the reporting period generated \u20ac1.2m profit.\nWith respect to fuel costs, for the corresponding year (FY ending 2017) the outcome of hedge contracts that were contracted in the previous year left a negative impact. For the reporting financial year, the company managed to successfully exploit the fuel market.\nFor the reporting year the company managed to leverage better contract terms with suppliers and exploited the forex market. It was thus able to save more on maintenance costs.\nDuring this year, the company pursued a growth strategy to take advantage of economies of scale, add value of the airline\u2019s brand and support the Maltese economy. We managed to carry over 2 million passengers over the previous period, an increase of over 300k passengers. The strategy included investment in new routes that the management is confident that will reap benefits in the forthcoming years.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of trees on urban heat temperatures.\nThe \u2018urban heat island\u2019 effect indicates that urban or built-up areas are warmer than natural open space areas. This was analysed by recording the surface temperature from two different areas \u2013 built-up areas (concrete/asphalt), and grassy patches with trees planted nearby. The objective was to find out the temperature differences between these two sites.\nInforming and involving the wider community.\nTaking a holistic approach the students learnt about global warming through science lessons. Experiments were held about greenhouses gases to understand how carbon dioxide (CO2) retains more heat and thus increases temperature.\nThe Global Learning and Observations to Benefit the Environment (Globe) programme is an international science and education programme that provides students and\u00a0the public worldwide with the opportunity to participate in data collection and the scientific process, and contribute meaningfully to our understanding of the earth system and global environment.\nThrough the programme, the students were directly involved in data collection and used it to investigate ways to mitigate high temperatures in built-up areas. Using an infrared thermometer the students measured surface temperatures during December. Readings were taken from two selected sites \u2013 the school ground covered in cement/asphalt and an open area in Victoria near the bus terminus, which is covered in grass and has trees planted in it.\nSurface temperature readings for December\nThe data collected showed that surface temperature varies on average by 9\u00b0C between vegetated surfaces and cemented/asphalt surfaces. Results support the statement that lack of trees contribute to the formation of \u2018urban heat islands\u2019.\nHaving discovered all this the students went a step further. They wanted to be part of the change, not just pointing fingers and complaining about the environmental degradation. The students carried out research on various local trees and shrubs including the Judas Tree, Myrtle, Aleppo Pine, Lentisk, Wild Thyme and others.\u00a0 They came up with an innovative idea on how to promote the growth of local indigenous trees.\nThe students prepared over 450 seed packs using recycled materials, such as toilet paper rolls and newspapers, and gave them out to students, teachers, school staff and other people who had participated in their Climate Action Fun Walk. The aim of the walk was to raise awareness about climate change and the need for action.\nIf these seeds are sown this could lead to an increase in the number of local trees, which are used to the Maltese islands\u2019 dry, hot climate, have less need for irrigation and therefore have a low water footprint. Such trees would lead to lower urban temperatures and less CO2 in the atmosphere.\nAn adopted turtle being released back to freedom.\nBe drastic, cut plastic\nPlastics are inexpensive and so are produced in very high quantities. However, the chemical structure of most plastics makes them long-lasting and resistant to many natural processes of degradation, meaning they take long to degrade, if ever. These two factors together have led to an excessive amount of plastic pollution in the environment.\nDuring a nature walk in one of Gozo\u2019s valleys, members from the EcoSchools committee carried out a litter survey and were impressed at the huge amount of plastic waste they found, most of which consisted of single-use plastic such as plastic bottles, plastic cutlers, cups and bags. While on site they picked up all litter they came across and ended up collecting over 30kg of waste.\nThe students were so overwhelmed that they decided to try to bring about change and to reduce or even stop the source of this curse. Back at school they carried out research and found some facts about plastic pollution, such as:\n\u2022 Plastics take a very long time to degrade;\n\u2022 Less than 10 per cent of plastics are recycled;\n\u2022 More than 80 per cent of plastic pollution in the ocean comes from land-based sources;\n\u2022 Plastics harm marine life;\n\u2022 Microplastics end up being consumed by marine animals, which in turn are consumed by humans.\nAll of this stirred in the students an urge to curb the use of single-use plastic. In an effort to reduce the adverse effects of plastic in the natural environment the students came up with a campaign entitled \u2018Be Drastic, Cut Plastic\u2019 which involved giving out mesh bags to encourage people to reduce their use of plastic bags.\nThe students went around the streets of Victoria and distributed the posters to fruit vendors, and gave free mesh bags to customers.\nThe students also undertook another initiative aimed at raising more awareness about marine litter created by single-use plastic and to give something back to nature.\nThey adopted a loggerhead turtle named Doris that has a missing flipper after being severely entangled by marine debris.\nThere seems to be light at the end of the tunnel as the European Parliament recently voted for a complete ban on a range of single-use plastics across the European Union by 2021 in a bid to reduce the pollution of the oceans.

The intention is to \u201csupport viable operations where the financial market is unable or unwilling to provide the needed funding on its own\u201d, the report explained.\nThe MDB is not only looking at SMEs but also at major infrastructural projects \u2013 mainly due to the long repayment period required to make them feasible \u2013 where there could be significant market failures and investment gaps.\nThe focus will be on projects with a strong social dimension \u2013 especially those related to education, health, elderly care, and affordable housing \u2013 as well as those that contribute to the green economy, including renewable energy and energy efficiency, sustainable transport and water resources, as well as other environment-friendly initiatives.\nThe MDB\u2019s annual report for 2018 is available on its website www.mdb.org.mt.", "comment_count": 0, "id": 3956}, {"keywords": "", "author": "", "article_body": "Updated at 12.45pm\nA young woman from Attard was seriously injured after she crashed her car into a parked one.

It also said the Nationalist Party could not be allowed to attack the free press, a prime ingredient in a democracy.\nRead:\u00a0Editorial - The PN vs the free press\nFollowing a two-day mission in Malta late last year, Reporters Without Borders warned the country was failing to live up to its obligations to guarantee and safeguard freedom of expression.\nIt remarked that the apparent lack of progress on the investigation into Ms Caruana Galizia\u2019s murder was having a chilling effect on public interest investigative reporting.\nHatred of journalists degenerating into violence\nThe number of countries where journalists can work safely is plummeting, Reporters Without Borders says.\nThe report said that hatred of journalists whipped up by populist and authoritarian leaders has degenerated into violence across the world, it warns.\nA total of 348 journalists were detained for providing news and information in 2018.\n\"If the political debate slides towards a civil war-style atmosphere, where journalists are treated as scapegoats, then democracy is in great danger,\" said Christophe Deloire, director general of RSF.\nThe period since Donald Trump's election in 2016 has been one of the \"American journalism community's darkest moments\", the report said, linking Trump's \"notorious anti-press rhetoric\" with \"terrifying harassment\" aimed particularly at women and journalists of colour.\nGovernment statement\nIn a statement, the government said it was committed to ensure that journalists in Malta could work without hindrance and in freedom, in accordance with the core values of a democratic society.\nThe Media and Defamation Act came into force in Malta, a new law regulating the freedom of the press and which among its various reforms in the sector abolished criminal libel, introduced the concept of the \u2018citizen journalist\u2019, introduced the concept of mediation, introduced various provisions which strengthened freedom of the media and prohibited the multiplicity of libel lawsuits in Malta on the same journalistic report.At the same time, the new law added no new burdens on journalists and owners of media houses in terms of civil libel damages.The government said that, in 2018, only 19 civil libel cases were filed, a third of the amount presented in 2017 (57) and a quarter of the amount presented in 2008 (77). This was indicative of the growing levels of freedom of journalistic expression.\nConcurrently, the right for any person to safeguard his or her reputation within the parameters of the judgments of the European Court of Human Rights had been kept, the government said.The report also criticises the fact that political parties in Malta own their own media outlets. The Government stresses that this situation has been unchanged since 1994. Media houses, which are privately owned, also have all the journalistic freedom to scrutinise and criticise all that they deem appropriate. The National Broadcaster also plays an important role and studies show that the news services of the national station are reliable and respected.The Government is committed to see that justice is done in the case of the barbaric homicide of Daphne Caruana Galizia. In fact, in less than 50 days from the homicide, three Maltese nationals were charged with her murder and they are facing ongoing proceedings in Court. At the same time investigators, assisted by foreign investigative authorities such as the FBI, Europol, Interpol and the Netherlands Forensic Institute amongst others, have left no stone unturned in their quest to bring to Court any other persons involved in this murder. At the same time, an independent and autonomous magisterial inquiry presided by Magistrate Neville Camilleri is ongoing.The Government contends that it has no objection for the launching of an independent public inquiry into whether the homicide of Ms Caruana Galizia could have been prevented, as is being requested, once that the current criminal inquiry and investigations are concluded. This stance is being taken on expert advice, both local and international, so that the pending criminal investigation is not adversely affected by another parallel public inquiry.The Government also refers to the issue of the possibility of having a multiplicity of libel lawsuits filed in foreign jurisdictions on media reports originating from Malta. It reiterates that it is in favour of any measure taken at European level which helps to safeguard freedom of expression in this sense.This is a reformist government with a will and commitment to continue with the ongoing reform process in the justice sector started in 2013. This process has already led to the implementation of several laws and reforms: a law deleting time-barring by prescription on claims of corruption by holders of political offices, a party financing legislation, a whistle-blower protection act, a law limiting the power of the Attorney General in drug-related cases, a new Parliamentary mechanism on appointment of chairpersons of main regulatory authorities and non-career Ambassadors, and a law establishing the Bureau for Recovery Assets.

This would be the third legislature to consider the project seriously, and the size of the project meant it merited a serious discussion.\nDr Said emphasised the burdens borne by those who were forced to commute from Gozo on a daily basis. At a minimum, he said, these Gozitans faced an additional 15 hours of travel when compared to their Maltese counterparts.

He pointed out that, although the Malta Freeport was the first land reclamation project which came to mind when the subject was broached, Msida was also the result of land reclamation which, admittedly, had not been executed \u201cbrilliantly\u201d.\nReferring to the Prime Minister\u2019s comments on the Opposition\u2019s insistence on short-term stopgap measures to ease Gozitans\u2019 commute, Opposition Leader Adrian Delia denied the claim that the Opposition was expecting the government to run roughshod over the adjudication process which was holding up the tender for fast-ferry services.

prison authorities to monitor those prisoners who, after appearing before the Prison Advisory Board, were granted the right to do pre-release work and community service.\nThis measure was generally

Degiorgio brothers, the Prison Director explained, pointing out that it was not within his remit to decide whether the facility should be extended to those granted bail.\nEarlier on in the sitting, lawyer William Cuschieri, assisting the Degiorgio brothers, argued that identical requests for bail in several instances were being heard by a limited number of judges who had already expressed their intention to deny bail.\nMadam Justice Lorraine Schembri Orland, however, said she did not feelthat the evidence showed that there \u201cis some imputation of prejudiceon the part of the judges who

stage, can be identified and evaluated accordingly, at the evaluation stage.\u201d\n\u201cSuch a condition will serve as a filter to the offers which are capable of delivering the tendered works and
