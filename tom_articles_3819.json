Committee chairman Beppe Fenech Adami argued that previous witnesses before the PAC had all been allowed to read out their statement, while Labour MP Robert Abela insisted this was at the discretion of the committee and demanded a vote.As a shouting match ensued, Dr Fenech Adami eventually requested a ruling from the Speaker and suspended the meeting.\n'No suggestion of illegality'\nIn his lengthy statement, a copy of which was provided to Times of Malta by Dr Azzopardi, the Nationalist MP repeatedly stressed that no illegality had ever been suggested, that all valuations had been drawn up by independent experts, and that he had not in any way influenced the negotiations.According to the NAO report, on March 5, 2013, just days before a general election, the Lands Department had signed a contract transferring two properties in Swieqi and San \u0120wann, worth \u20ac4.3 million jointly, as payment for land expropriated at Fekruna Bay, Xemxija.The Fekruna land was valued at \u20ac5 million and the difference in favour of Fekruna Ltd, \u20ac700,000, was offset against amounts due to the government by the company in lieu of capital gains tax and duty on documents.The report found that taxpayers had lost more than \u20ac1 million through the deal. However, it also acknowledged that the goal of acquiring the land to return it to its original state had served the public interest.Dr Azzopardi said on Wednesday that as a result of the deal, the public had a guarantee that that environmentally sensitive site would remain accessible and would never be built up. He said three different architects commissioned by the Government Property Department (GPD) in 2010 had all reached the same valuation of \u20ac5 million. Architects commissioned by Fekruna Ltd had valued the land at between \u20ac6.75 and \u20ac7.5 million.Would it have been just for the expropriation not to take place simply because there was an election around the corner?Dr Azzopardi said the valuation was realistic and reasonable when compared to the expropriation in 1996 of a similar-sized plot - which, in contrast, was not developable - for around \u20ac932,000. He also said the sites in Swieqi and San \u0120wann were not chosen by Fekruna Ltd but by the Lands Department, and valued by three jointly-chosen experts. \u201cIf the only criticism is that the expropriation took place a few days before the general election, my answer is clear: after more than three and a half years of negotiation, would it have been just for the expropriation not to take place simply because there was an election around the corner?\u201dDr Azzopardi said that if there had been any illegality in the process, the Labour government had every legal right and opportunity to revoke the deal, but that it had opted instead for \u201ccowardly mud-slingling\u201d.

One of the main drivers of excessive prescription of antibiotics, he said, was a \u2018better safe than sorry\u2019 culture, also known as uncertainty avoidance.\u00a0\nStill, with 92% of the Maltese population being aware that unnecessary use of antibiotics will make them ineffective, culture could be changed, he added.\nDraft proposals of the national strategy\u00a0action plan that will kick off this year\n\u25a0 Enhance knowledge and awareness on AMR among healthcare and veterinary professionals by ensuring availability of continuing professional education activities on AMR and prudent use of antibiotics, not sponsored by the industry.\n\u25a0 Strengthen surveillance system of antibiotic resistance especially in primary care and veterinary practice.\n\u25a0 Introduce electronic systems that include antimicrobial prescribing and link them to clinical indication and consumption data.\n\u25a0 Develop a system for safe disposal of antibiotics in the community.\n\u25a0 Fast track the procurement of new antibiotics effective against currently resistant organisms.", "comment_count": 4, "id": 1057}, {"keywords": "", "author": "", "article_body": "Two specialised panels are being appointed to the Administrative Review Tribunal to hear cases involving gaming and digital innovation, Justice Minister Owen Bonnici said on Tuesday.\u00a0\nThe members on the panels will be specialised personnel, something which would help the tribunal take more informed and precise decisions, the minister said.\nThe appointment of the additional panels would also enable the tribunal to take decisions in a shorter time, benefiting the parties and reducing the caseload.\u00a0\nDr Bonnici said the government 'remained committed to carry out more reforms to strengthen the rule of law and human rights, including the right to justice within a reasonable time.\u00a0", "comment_count": 0, "id": 1058}, {"keywords": "", "author": "", "article_body": "Blogger Manuel Delia was Adrian Delia's ghostwriter during his campaign for the Nationalist Party leadership, the head of the PN's media, Pierre Portelli, told a court on Tuesday.\nMr Portelli was testifying in proceedings instituted by Manuel Delia against Media.Link editor Robert Cremona.\nThe case was instituted after Media.Link refused to publish a statement issued by Mr Delia in reply to a story it had carried.\u00a0\nMr Portelli said that he had been informed of the Right of Reply sent by Manuel Delia following a Net News story in which they said that he had mistakenly reported that the PN parliamentary group voted in favour of a law allowing cannabis cultivation in Malta.\nIn a subsequent blog post, Delia argued that he had only reported that Adrian Delia cut short debate on the matter in the parliamentary group and failed to declare the interest of his wife\u2019s family and a close aide of his in the sector.\nMr Portelli explained that he had instructed his staff not to publish the Right of Reply.\n\u201cI issued the instruction that this wasn\u2019t to be published as it was a Right of Reply to a Right of Reply.

By Fiona Galea Debono\nThe next time you bite into a crusty ftira on a quick guilt-tripping lunch break, think that this is more than just a chunk of bread \u2013 and a whole lot of carbs \u2013 but also a slice of intangible cultural heritage, and that \u201cits production and consumption need to be considered before it is too late\u201d.\nThat may be quite a mouthful when you are just minding your own business, piling on the pounds. But for food historian Noel Buttigieg, ftira is his bread and butter in more ways than one \u2013 research into its past and its preservation into the future has been ongoing for 11 years.\nAt a time when the consumption per capita of Maltese bread is decreasing, ftira becomes an immediate contender, he laments. \u201cWhile the Maltese still consume bread, the market today is spoilt for choice. We have developed a taste for other breads [rather than Maltese], and the local market is now also importing it.\n\u201cWe are not saying that ftira is at risk, but its production and consumption need to be looked into before it is too late,\u201d warns Dr Buttigieg, a lecturer at the Institute of Tourism, Travel and Culture at the University of Malta.\n\u201cIt is time to recognise the importance of this intangible cultural heritage and do something about it before it is gone. It is also time the Maltese recognised other aspects of intangible cultural heritage, such as the making of lace, cheese, boats and g\u0127ana.\u201d\nOne of the problems of ftira, according to Dr Buttigieg, is that people are not noticing that it has, and still is, changing in its nature, form and taste. This is happening both in the production process and in the way it is being prepared for consumption.\nFood is an integral part of the nation\u2019s identity\n\u201cMy children love eating it with Nutella,\u201d Dr Buttigieg hesitates to admit.\nThings have certainly changed from when the schiaccata [flattened bread] was supplied to slaves, according to a 16th century document. Yes, ftira goes back that far, and the linguist Giovanni Francesco Agius de Soldanis also provides evidence related to it, referred to as xawwata, back in the 18th century.\nDr Buttigieg\u2019s main interest lies in the history and anthropology of food. Speaking about the proposal to include ftira in Unesco\u2019s List of Intangible Cultural Heritage, he insists the process is rigorous and needs to emerge through public consultation and not be simply the opinion of the few.\nThose who have come forward to support ftira\u2019s\u00a0nomination and signed petitions are testimony that the Maltese are not only aware of their culinary past, but also their culinary present. But of course, the younger generations consider Kinnie, Twistees and cheesecakes to be the three main markers of Malta\u2019s culinary identity, Dr Buttigieg admits about today\u2019s reality.\u00a0\u00a0\nOne of the reasons behind the nomination is, indeed, the fact that \u201cit is high time we inform and educate. Food is an integral part of the nation\u2019s identity, and as a result of globalisation and its democratisation, generations are forgetting their past\u201d.\nThe diet trends of the moment, which tend to blacklist white bread, may serve to flatten ftira\u2019s cause, and many would consider\u00a0a talk\u00a0on\u00a0its historical, artisanal and culinary qualities, scheduled for January 24, to be\u00a0a case of over-glorifying a piece of bread.\nMoreover, with so many Maltese overlooking their built heritage as it is, appreciating that food is also part of their history may be even harder to swallow.\nDr Buttigieg is, however, expecting the public to bite.\nThe aim of the lecture at the Inquisitor\u2019s Palace in Vittoriosa is for the public to be able to chew on the process that led to the selection to register ftira as part of the Intangible Cultural Heritage Inventory of Malta and to have an application that the Maltese community of producers and consumers have bought into.\u00a0\nFtira anyone?\nwww.heritagemalta.org", "comment_count": 13, "id": 1101}, {"keywords": "", "author": "Jacob Borg", "article_body": "A \u20ac100,000 \u201cloan\u201d by Keith Schembri, ostensibly to help his auditor Brian Tonna with separation costs, was dated at a time when the Tonnas were still buying property together as a married couple, documents seen by The Sunday Times of Malta show.\nAccording to a leaked report by the Financial Intelligence Analysis Unit (FIAU), the loan agreement is suspected to be a \u201cbogus\u201d means to justify two \u20ac50,000 payments made to Mr Schembri by Mr Tonna in 2015.

We were also given the opportunity to mould bone china paste into shapes and figures.\nWe learnt that porcelain was invented in China during the Tang dynasty (AD618-907) by mixing kaolin (china clay) and pegmatite, a coarse type of granite. The first Chinese porcelain wares appeared in Europe in the Middle Ages and although Europeans tried for a long time to copy it they did not succeed.\nIt was only in 1707 that two Germans \u2013 Ehrenfried Walter von Tschimhaus and\u00a0Johann Friedrich Bottger\u00a0\u2013 succeeded to imitate bone china by combining clay with ground feldspar. The first European hard-paste porcelain was produced in 1710 in Meissen, near Dresden, and Meissen Porcelain or Meissen China became one of the most famous porcelain manufacturers in the world.\nLater in the 18th century the English improved upon the German recipe for porcelain by adding ash from cattle bones to clay, feldspar and quartz.\nWhereas porcelain is translucent, bone china is opaque, softer and easier to cut, and is also fired at lower temperature. Although bone china is fired at lower temperatures than true porcelain, the bone ash enables it to become translucent.\nBecause bone china is easier to make, harder to chip, and stronger than hard porcelain, it has become the most popular type of porcelain in the US and the UK.\nThe authors are students atSt Margaret College Senior Secondary School, Verdala, Cospicua.", "comment_count": 0, "id": 1112}, {"keywords": "Education", "author": "", "article_body": "Francesca Alotta, who together with singer Aleandro Baldi won the San Remo festival in 1992 with the song Non Amarmi, performed during the annual Christmas concert of Mater Boni Consilii St\u00a0 Joseph School, Paola, in aid of charity.
