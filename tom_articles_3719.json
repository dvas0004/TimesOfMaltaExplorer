They are also inexplicably dismissive of the method of regulation of innovative digital developments in this sector.\n\u201cIt is to be noted that while Prof. Montgomery seeks to cast such doubts, he does not make any comment of the standing and reputation of the private German hospitals that provide the practical training as an integral part of the courses offered by the European Digital University.\n\u201cIn putting forward Prof. Montgomery\u2019s views, the article in question states, with reference to the European Digital University, that \u2018He said he was informed the company had only decided to come to Malta as it had been informed it would be given the go-ahead by the authorities in a relatively short period of time\u2019. Nothing could be further from the truth.\n\u201cThe identification of Malta as an ideal hub for the development of digital technology, with a particular emphasis on the health and medical sphere, dates back to 2012. This is when the promoters of the EDU decided to come to Malta and this was done on the basis of Malta\u2019s publicly-stated pledge and commitment of setting the island as a centre of excellence in research and technological innovation.

But the fact that a lot the trucks are left-hand drive is making the roads even more dangerous.\n\u201cAny left-hand drive vehicle, whether commercial or not, is dangerous due to the higher number of blind spots, and this is adding to the danger,\u201d he said.\nMr Vella was contacted following an appeal made by the parents of a motorcyclist crushed by a left-hand drive truck in January 2016.\nMotorcyclist Johanna Boni was run over by a cement mixer in Labour Avenue, Naxxar, at about 8am on January 5, 2016. The 27-year-old was riding her Kawasaki ER6N to work on that fateful morning.\n\u201cI think trucks must be subjected to stricter checks. Trucks must not be loaded more than a certain amount. Left-hand drive trucks must disappear... those which come from abroad must have a co-driver because the blind spot is too dangerous. This is my biggest worry.

In other countries, such as the UK, this is already the norm,\u201d he said.\nMr Vella said they also discussed the possibility of having a larger number of external mirrors on the right-hand side which would, to a certain extent, make good for the lack of visibility.\nHe said he believed that left-hand drive vehicles needed to be properly identified as such and the council had discussed the possibility of proper signage, with a big LHD on the back of the vehicle as well as on the right-hand side, so as to warn drivers of the possible dangers and blind spots.\nThe VRT test does not differentiate between right- or left-hand drive trucks. Neither do Transport Malta\u2019s statistics make any distinction, with sources close to the transport watchdog saying that there were no statistics on the number of LHD trucks currently registered to drive on Malta\u2019s roads.\nAccording to the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents in the UK, in 2011, 18 people were killed, 47 seriously injured and 720 slightly injured in road accidents involving foreign-registered left-hand drive heavy goods vehicles.\nIts research indicated that left-hand drive vehicles are 3.4 times more likely to be involved in crashes than right-hand drive vehicles. They suggested better mirrors that reduce the driver\u2019s blind spot to be fitted and were behind schemes to supply free Fresnel lenses to drivers as they enter the country.\nThe EU is also discussing a new regulation of trucks to replace the bottom panels of the driver\u2019s and passenger\u2019s door with glass so as to see any cyclists or motorcyclists. \u00a0\nThe third Joanna Boni memorial ride was held today.", "comment_count": 36, "id": 1323}, {"keywords": "", "author": "Ivan Camilleri", "article_body": "Marouska Pisani Bugeja, who until two years ago was a top official at the PN\u2019s media arm, was recently put on the government\u2019s payroll with a financial package of over \u20ac34,000 for a part-time role, The Sunday Times of Malta is informed.\nMs Pisani Bugeja was recruited directly by Parliamentary Secretary for EU Funds and Social Dialogue Aaron Farrugia, without a public call, to advise him on \u201cmatters related to communications\u201d.\nAaron Farrugia\u2019s new advisor Marouska Pisani Bugeja.\nHowever, the 36-year-old has kept her full-time job as business development manager at WeMedia, the company which produces TV programmes for the State broadcaster, including the popular programme Xarabank.\nAsked whether her full-time job, which involves seeking new business opportunities for WeMedia including sponsorships and adverts, and her job with the parliamentary secretary might put her in a conflit of loyalties, a spokeswoman for Dr Farrugia said \u201cMs Pisani Bugeja has no conflict of interest\u201d.\nPoliticians, particularly novice ones like Dr Farrugia, are known to be keen to appear on mainstream TV stations and popular programmes in order to boost their political profile.\nSources close to Net TV, the PN\u2019s TV station, told the newspaper that many were surprised by the sudden departure of Ms Pisani Bugeja from her top post at the station in 2016.\nAs Dr Farrugia\u2019s advisor, Ms Pisani Bugeja is contracted to work 30 hours a week for the parliamentary secretary and is paid \u20ac18.23 per hour.

This project in St Monika Street, in the style of the notorious Vele di Scampia in Naples, will completely change not only the garden and my project, but the entire area,\u201d he said.\nWhen he got wind of the application, simulations of the development in question were created in the context of the villa, and the proposed seven floors will tower over the house and garden, meaning \u201cthere is no doubt that my project will lose all its potential value\u201d.\nMr Pagot thinks \u201cMalta should reconcile its economic interests with respect for its origins, its history and the image it has in the world. I understand the economic aspects of speculation, but I believe that man should rediscover respect for others and try to make his own interests coincide with a wider well-being. Of course, I am not only talking about respect towards Casa Gwardamagia and myself; I\u2019m speaking about the entire community of Piet\u00e0 and Malta.\n\u201cThe island attracts visitors due to its history and certainly not for new developments, which, in most cases, have no architectural value. If its beauty were to be suffocated by these mediocre structures, foreign investors would probably turn to other destinations.\u201d\nWhen Mr Pagot had to rebuild the simple dividing wall between Casa Gwardamangia and the neighbouring garden, he said he abided by precise limitations, maintaining a height that would not exceed that of the church parvis.\n\u201cI accepted these conditions, of course, seeing this as proof of how much Piet\u00e0 was attentive to the protection of aspects of Maltese history.\u201d\nThe proposed development also brings with it parking problems \u2013 one of the gravest issues Mr Pagot has encountered in Malta, with Piet\u00e0 being certainly no exception.\nRead:\u00a0Piet\u00e0 council shoots down massive development project\n\u201cThe very limited number of car spaces the development would provide shows the lack of attention to the complications this would cause.\n\u201cIn Tokyo, where I lived for six years, every apartment had to provide at least two parking spaces. In this case, there will be a shortage of around 100 to 150. Who will take care of this?\u201d\nThe island attracts visitors due to its history and certainly not for new developments\nMr Pagot\u2019s architect, Joanna Spiteri Staines, a partner at Openworkstudio, who specialises in the restoration of old buildings, described the \u201cunder siege scheduled\u201d garden as \u201cexotic\u201d and \u201cfull of beautiful trees\u201d, the former owner being an expert at growing avocado.\nAt most, she said, the property could have been more modestly developed, surrounding the garden, rather than including an \u201coutrageous\u201d seven floors.\nAn application has been submitted to the Planning Authority to build 114 apartments in St Monika Street, Piet\u00e0.\nIn the space of a week, apart from the news about Casa Gwardamangia, she also received a call from the owner of an \u201cout of this world\u201d, pre-Great Siege, Grade 1 scheduled building in Tarxien, which is also at risk; and was contacted by another disillusioned person to value a villa that is now being overlooked by yet another development.\nAn application to build a \u201cnon-descript\u201d block of flats across the road from the Tarxien house would ruin the streetscape, Ms Spiteri Staines said, adding that doing this in a relatively unspoilt street was setting a dangerous precedent, which would have a domino effect.\n\u201cAfter all, it is the context that matters,\u201d she said, giving as an example of plonking Michelangelo\u2019s David in front of a block of flats instead of in Florence\u2019s Piazza della Signoria. \u201cThe beauty and importance of the statue would be lost. And if we cannot appreciate the beauty of David in its context, that makes us a bunch of savages.\u201d\nThe property, which has been in the family for three centuries, should have a buffer zone in front of the house too and not just behind, she insisted. The owner, she said, had been fighting in court to have the surrounding area properly protected.\n\u201cIn the Guardamangia case, we are talking about a 300-year-old house that is being devalued,\u201d continued Ms Spiteri Staines, who also does pro bono work for Din l-Art \u0126elwa to help save Malta\u2019s heri\u00adtage and environment.\nIf there is no buffer zone between urban conservation areas and new build and mass develop\u00adment, people\u2019s homes are being devalued at the stroke of a pen with these applications, and this after they would have spent a fortune on restoration and rehabi\u00adli\u00adtation, Ms Spiteri Staines stressed.\n\u201cMoreover, the body in place to protect their value and our heri\u00adtage should be fighting for protection of our heritage, streetscapes and controlling urban development to respect the context rather than enabling these applications to go through.\u201d\nThe situation is devastating and Ms Spiteri Staines said it is down to \u201cthose who would sell their mother to make a quick buck, and those whose attitude is: \u2018if you can\u2019t beat them, join them\u2019, claiming that if others did it, why should they have their garden permanently in the shade of a block of flats. You can\u2019t really blame the latter either,\u201d she admits.\n\u201cWe need to see more buffer zones and more buildings being scheduled. The policies and deve\u00adlopment guidelines of the Planning Authority talk ad nauseam about respecting the context, but this is totally overlooked by the decision-making boards,\u201d she said, adding that the Superintendence of Cultural Heritage is still understaffed, but trying its utmost to reverse this negative trend.\nA good example of the protection of a buffer zone and the community\u2019s fight against the ruin of the context of a monument was the area surrounding the Gourgon Tower in Lija in 2008, she said.\nMs Spiteri Staines is calling for a master plan for Guaradmangia that would give deserved value to all the historical buildings in the area.\n\u201cWe should have a vision for this area, which is totally undervalued and horrendously exploited by overdevelopment, when in truth, it has so much potential,\u201d she said, adding that the buildings on Piet\u00e0\u2019s waterfront are as old as the Pinto Stores and the whole area could be another Valletta Waterfront, with the road pushed out into the sea, or passing through a tunnel.\nReferring to the Public Domain Act, a relatively new, but as yet unused, tool for the State to buy sights of cultural, historical and social importance for the country, Ms Spiteri Staines encouraged it to buy Villa Guardamangia, further up the road, and turn it into a British museum.\nOnce the Queen\u2019s residence and now on the market, she said Villa Guardamangia should be the first attempt to give due importance to the 150 years of British rule in Malta, celebrating, discussing and shedding light on this era.\n\u201cIt is a tidal wave of development and destruction and we are not even seeing it,\u201d Ms Spiteri Staines said. \u201cBut with vision, we can control development, rather than let deve\u00adlopment lead the way, leaving us with the only option to be reactive.\u201d\nThe ancient Greeks used to say that a society grows great when old men plant trees in whose shade they know they shall never sit. In Malta, we seem to have turned this concept on its head.\n\u201cIt is hard to abandon a dream, but, undoubtedly, if the Santa Monika project is approved, I would no longer have a reason to make Casa Gwardamangia my main home,\u201d Mr Pagot admitted.\nThe vision for a historical home\nAfter hearing stories of Malta\u2019s charm, in 2016 Marco Pagot travelled to the island to search for a home in which to \u201ccreate and dream\u201d.\u00a0\n\u201cI immediately saw in Malta the possibility to have a home where I could work with other artists on the creation of new projects. I was looking for a quiet corner, a bit cut off from the real world, and when I set eyes on Casa Gwardamangia, I immediately understood that it could fit the bill,\u201d he recalls.\nDespite being abandoned for over 40 years, the house\u2019s structure and its wild garden were of unique design and proportions, he found. He began to write a screen\u00adplay with Casa Gwardamangia as the protagonist \u2013 and to think of a future with \u2018her\u2019.\nOnce he bought the property, the project kicked off. The idea was to create a guesthouse for artists to unite in a serene and enchanting environment, with\u00a0 events designed for them to present and share their works.\nDriven by the idea to preserve the image of old Malta, the plan was that any new build would be as minimally invasive as possible, hidden under the garden, or replicating the style of the island at the time of construction of the house.\nThis is how the respectful relationship with heritage and historical buildings should be \u2013 almost human.

On the other hand, the international hotel chain Corinthia is acquiring a commercial concession worth \u20ac700 million for just \u20ac17 million, according to a draft deed that must still be approved by Parliament.\nThe analysis was carried out by a group of property experts together with The Sunday Times of Malta.\nThe db Group is planning to build a five-star hotel and a residential 38-storey tower on 24,000 square metres of public land at the former ITS site. The Corinthia, which has three hotels on the peninsula, wants to turn a land concession exclusively for tourism purposes into a deal for apartments and offices to be included on a tract of 60,000 square metres.\nCorinthia\u2019s chairman Alfred Pisani and his team of negotiators appear to have secured several advantages over Seabank\u2019s negotiators, led by chairman Silvio Debono.\nThe latter, for example, are obliged to fork out the whole of the \u20ac15 million premium over a specified seven-year period while the former will only have to fork out \u20ac4 million three years after the deed is signed.\nCorinthia\u2019s payment of the remaining \u20ac13 million, into public coffers, is based on how much of the commercial area it decides to develop and eventually sell.\n\u201cThe balance in the sum of \u20ac13 million shall, subject to any reductions in accordance with the previous clause 10 below, be payable on a pro rata basis with respect to each portion of net internal saleable area designated for Office and/or Residential use on the Effective Date,\u201d the still unpublished draft deed states.\nThe property experts consulted by the newspaper emphasised their \u201cdisgust\u201d at the way the government is negotiating valuable public land.\nThe two deeds, they said, showed how the Corinthia had managed to obtain a \u201cfar better\u201d deal from Konrad Mizzi, the Tourism Minister who represented the government on the two deals.\n\u201cObviously, Corinthia had the advantage of negotiating terms which had already been made public on the ITS deed. Thus, as expected, the government was not really in a position to negotiate after the \u2018ridiculous\u2019 terms given to the Seabank db Group,\u201d one expert said.\n\u201cFor sure, Maltese citizens will be worse off from all this, as their land is going to be speculated for the benefit of a few families instead of the common good.\u201d\nRead:\u00a0Corinthia deal talks reopen after warning on state aid\nDr Mizzi admitted in Parliament that negotiations with the Corinthia Group were based on the same parameters as those given to the Seabank db Group.\nPrime Minster Joseph Muscat \u2013 who last week admitted that the government was now taking a second look at the negotiations following the public outcry \u2013 argued that he did not want to discriminate against Corinthia. This was a clear reference to the terms already given by the government to the db Group.\nWhen it became public in 2018, the Seabank deal was slammed by the business community and the Opposition. It is now being investigated by the National Audit Office. Yet, permits have been issued for the db project to go ahead while the government based the Corinthia deal on its \u2018dubious\u2019 parameters.\nWhen compared, the two deeds look very similar in the terms and allowances negotiated with the government. However, the Corinthia\u2019s wins out on a number of counts.\nWhile both deals are for an empythuetical grant of 99 years, Corinthia has also been given the right of first refusal upon the termination of the original grant.\nRead: Developers say government selling land at below market prices\nIt was also granted unlimited rights to reclaim the seabed around the peninsula, a potentially lucrative clause which the ITS deal does not include.\nCorinthia says it has no intention of using its land reclamation rights but when asked if it was ready to drop them, the group argued that this was up to the government.\nAlso, while db will have to fork out a minimum investment of \u20ac150 million in order to build their mixed development, Corinthia are only obliged to fork out \u20ac100 million for the first phase, which will take at least another decade to complete.\nCorinthia has declared that for now, it only has the intention of completing the first phase, which will include the upgrading of the Corinthia Hotel St George\u2019s Bay \u2013 without demolishing the current structure \u2013 and the building of 18,000 square metres of sea-view serviced apartments for sale.\nIt is only in the event that they decide to go for the full development of the peninsula, which allows them to build and sell up to 100,000 square metres of apartments and office/retail areas, that they will have an obligation to invest up to \u20ac300 million. No dates are set in the deed on when the whole project should be completed.\nIn another advantageous move for Corinthia, the government also conceded that the hotel group may renegotiate the whole deal in the event of a change in the country\u2019s economic climate.\nAccording to a specific clause inserted in the draft deed, if at some point in future \u201ceconomic and other relevant conditions are not conducive to the implementation of the full Project and that the full Project is only attainable if FSHL (the Corinthia company) is to endure disproportionate economic hardship, then both sides shall agree in good faith on the optimum timing and best course of action at such point, in the best interests of both Parties, including the national economy\u201d.\nRead:\u00a0Stop trafficking public land, NGO tells government\nAccording to experts, this clause guarantees Corinthia a \u201crisk-free\u201d development.\nWhile rights to the ITS site was subject to a public call for tenders \u2013 which surprisingly only the Seabank db Group submitted despite Corinthia\u2019s initial interest\u2013 the rights to the rest of the peninsula were not.\nThe Corinthia argues that it already has possession of the land, which was granted to them in the 1990s for exclusive hotel use. However, the new deed will change the parameters of the concession, granting the hotel chain new rights to speculate with public land.\nAccording to laws, this can only be done through a public tender and after a new parliamentary resolution. Under the current deeds, the Corinthia Group cannot build and sell any commercial property on the land.\nThe draft deed needs to be approved by a simple majority in Parliament, which is expected to debate the matter in February.\nPaceville plot asking Price: \u20ac16 million\nA 1,075 square metre plot of land in Paceville, not far from the St George\u2019s Bay peninsula, is on sale for \u20ac16 million.\nThe plot is described on the websites of estate agents as \u201ca unique and rare opportunity to purchase one of Paceville\u2019s last remaining large sites\u201d for mixed development.\nCorinthia\u2019s concession for the development of commercial property on a far larger tract of land was, by contrast, given away by the government for a premium payment of just \u20ac17 million. The Paceville plot is also far inferior to the St George\u2019s Bay site, being inland.\nThe Times of Malta reported last week that the government has been given legal advice that the Corinthia deal might expose it to an infringement of EU State aid rules as it may put real estate developers on an uneven playing field.\nThe government denied this but admitted it has re-opened negotiations with Corinthia.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nSeabank db Group \u2013 ITS deal\nCorinthia \u2013 San Gorg Peninsula deal\n\n\nPublic Tender\nYES\nNO\n\n\nSite Size\n23,975 sq metres\n60,975 sq metres\n\n\nMaximum commercial building size allowed (GFA)\n58,502 sq metres\n100,000 sq metres\n\n\nLand reclamation\nNO\nYES - Unlimited\n\n\nDuration\n99 years\n99 years\n\n\nMinimum investment obligation\n\u20ac150 million\n\u20ac100 million \u2013 Phase 1\n\n\nEstimated current market price of concession\n\u20ac409.5 million\n\u20ac700 million\n\n\nPremium payment agreed with government\n\u20ac15 million\n\u20ac17 million\n\n\nPayment\u00a0 terms\nStaggered over 7 years\nStaggered \u2013 according to development phases (can take decades)\n\n\nPayment upon deed\n\u20ac5 million\n\u20ac1 million\n\n\nConversion of temporary to perpetual emphyteusis by third parties\nYES\nYES\n\n\nObligation of conversion to perpetual emphyteusis\nNO\nYes \u2013 by third parties or Corinthia after two years from sale\n\n\nRight to sell (transfer) concession\nYES \u2013 with government consent\nYES \u2013 with government consent\n\n\n\n\u00a0", "comment_count": 22, "id": 1329}, {"keywords": "", "author": "", "article_body": "A 39-year old man was arraigned in court on Sunday on charges of domestic violence.The man, who cannot be named by court order, pleaded not guilty to slightly injuring his partner at their home on Friday, and to causing her to live in fear of violence over the previous years.Magistrate Audrey Demicoli issued a protection order in favour of the victim, but accepted a request for bail after the defence said the accused would reside at a different address.

Its residential community is the soul of the city; the businesses keep it alive and also employ a number of people from within the community itself; then, there are also the realities that it is a tourist hub and an administrative centre.\nThe challenge lies in balancing all its conflicting needs. During my tenure, at times it felt like I was being sandwiched between the different needs of each faction. This, while trying ensure that the interests of Valletta are given priority.\nThe truth is that Valletta residents are under threat\nWhat about the specifics?\nThe current wave of construction, which leans too much towards the commercial interests as opposed to the interests of the city itself, is one of the biggest challenges.\nI cannot imagine Valletta without its residents, but this is the direction that the city is taking.\nWe need to take a macro approach that takes into consideration how the details of a commercial decision will affect residents. But this is not an approach that is being favoured by the entities responsible.\nAs an example, consider when restaurants are granted permits outside of the commercial zones, in the residential area. Such permits trigger multiple consequences on the daily lives of residents living nearby. Parking problems increase; in the warmer weather, people are likely to hang outside smoking and chattering; there will be more noise\u2026\nAs mayor, I always supported businesses, but all these details need to be considered too.

But a more holistic policy is needed, not this piecemeal approach.\nHow can this impasse be solved?\nI favour balance. Let\u2019s take boutique hotels as an example.

I suddenly started noticing when people took out their garbage bags at the wrong time, and could not understand why.\nBecoming mayor also made me think more about the long-term future of the city. I never looked at Valletta 2018; I look at Valletta 2030, or even 2040. No-one discusses this.\nWhere will the city be in 30 years\u2019 time? The entities are too fragmented and they only look at the issues they face, individually. This is why Valletta needs genuine residents, to secure a future.\nI cannot imagine Valletta without its residents but this is the direction that the city is taking\nAre there residents that are not genuine?\nThere are a lot of speculators buying property and re-selling it in the short term. They do not live there, they do not become part of the community and they add nothing to the city.\nI know many instances where people bought properties in Valletta and literally left them in the same state in which they bought them \u2013 then they resold them at a profit after a couple of years.\nOthers buy properties and rent out these places on a short-term basis. This is what I mean by Valletta needs genuine residents; people who will buy a place and actually live there.\nResidents who do live there and who complain that their needs are not given priority are often told that this is the price one pays for living in Valletta. What is your reaction to this?\nResidents were there before the businesses. They were there when there were no restaurants and when Valletta would become a ghost town by 6pm. Residents are the soul of Valletta. They have more right to be there than others.\nSo where do you see Valletta in 10 years\u2019 time?\nI\u2019d like to be optimistic. I see the regeneration and restoration process nearing completion; a revolution in the transport system. Valletta is small enough to manage an alternative, greener transport solution.\nI see Valletta becoming more liveable, becoming a space where you can raise a family, and where you can find places of entertainment too. I see it achieving this balance. This is what I\u2019d like to see, of course.\nYou are known for being very passionate about your home city. What led you to resign from the post of mayor a few months before elections were due?\nI wanted to give more importance and time to my full-time profession at University and to my family. Being mayor of Valletta is very time-consuming, of course. It was the best time for me to do this.\nWhat are some of the achievements that you look back on with satisfaction?\nThere were many moments of satisfaction, because I was lucky enough to have a great team. Concluding the bid for Valletta 2018 comes to mind. We were being interviewed for the second time and we showcased a video of a young boy playing music. One of the judges asked, what would make us rate Valletta 2018 as a success, down the line.\nI replied that I\u2019d consider the city\u2019s tenure a success if it paved the way for allowing that boy to foster his talent on a professional level.\nThis reply must have struck a chord, because soon after we were informed that we had won the title. It was a defining moment, the start of a very exciting time for Valletta.\nThe renovation of Saint George\u2019s Square was another proud moment. I used to describe it as the most beautiful car park in Europe.\nRemoving it was not an easy decision to take, on a political level. The business community was extremely upset. But the move catapulted an entire change in mentality. Once the square started being restored, we seemed to realise that not every small space needs to be turned into a car park. The restoration of St George\u2019s Square was a catalyst.", "comment_count": 69, "id": 1336}, {"keywords": "", "author": "Matthew Xuereb", "article_body": "The Planning Authority last week threw out an application to develop part of a garden that once formed part of the servants\u2019 quarters of a scheduled 18th century palazzo in \u017bejtun.\nThe application was seeking to build 20 residential units and underlying garages in a part of the garden of Villa Curmi in \u017bejtun.

It is a day when we remember a world scarred by genocide \u2013 not only under Nazi persecution, but also the genocides in Cambodia, Rwanda, Bosnia and Darfur.\nLast October, a group of students and teachers from St Aloysius\u2019 College secondary school, Birkirkara, visited Nazi death camps in Poland. The group, which included three teachers and 16 fifth form students, spent four days in Poland and visited both Auschwitz and Birkenau camps.\nThomas Sciberras Herrera, a fifth form student who formed part of the group, said the visit to the camps left a very strong im\u00adpact on the students. \u201cAs we were walking in and out of the rooms, in the different barracks, we could see thousands of shoes, crutches, wheelchairs, baby clothes and luggage.

items had gone missing from the Monte\u2019s vaults.\nInvestigators had later searched the suspect\u2019s home where they discovered a number of valuables and some 11 pawning tickets.\nCriminal charges were issued against the official who was alleged to have borrowed money by pawning several personal gold items and taking those valuables back home without first redeeming the loan.\nA high-ranking officer at the Monte, testifying in the proceedings, had explained how the pawner would obtain a \u201ccalculated capital advance\u201d after his valuable was assessed by an appraiser.\nThe loan would be accompanied by a pawning ticket, a counterfoil copy of which was kept at the Monte, the senior official had explained, adding that the original ticket would be affixed to

items and other precious jewels, as well as a handbag and a silver purse, together with the 11 unredeemed pawning tickets.\nThe prosecution had failed to present a list of the items as well as any receipt or seizure note referring to said valuables, the court observed.\nThere had been \u201can absolute failure\u201d on the part of the prosecution to determine which of the items discovered at

confirmed on appeal.\nYet in more recent times, the principle of legal assistance in the pre-trial phase was acknowledged not only by a long line of EU judgments, but also by local jurisprudence, such as the judgment delivered in Brian Vella vs AG in December 2018.\nIn that case, a statement released by the accused at a time when a one-hour consultation with his lawyer was permissible at law, was declared inadmissible as evidence against the accused.\nIt was precisely in the light of this scenario that Mr Pirotta had filed a constitutional case seeking adequate redress.\nHowever, that case, currently pending before the First Hall, Civil Court, had been adjourned for judgment 13 times over the past one-year-and-a-half, prompting the applicant to file a judicial protest, holding the State responsible for damages, while reserving the right to take ulterior action.\nWhile acknowledging that adjournments for health reasons were always justified, and while closing an eye to some \u201cone

All sites are then challenged to complete games based on that theme by Sunday afternoon.\nThe 55 Maltese participants will assemble at the Institute of Digital Games at the University of Malta, which has been organising the local jam since the institute was founded in 2013. This year, registrations closed early due to high demand.\nJasper Schellekens, research support officer at the institute, told Times of Malta that the event has seen an increase in interest and participation over the years.\u00a0\nHe attributes this partly to the fact that a varied range of skills are required to make a game and thus the event does not only attract students of the institute.\n\n\u201cWhen we\u2019re talking about digital games, a programmer is essential but there is a role for non-programming participants regardless of background. Depending on the type of game the team is working on, artists, sound designers and writers can find a role. But even beyond that, any discipline can provide the foundations for a game play,\u201d he pointed out.\nThe jam is not just restricted to video games but one can also try their hands at designing board games. A board game titled \u2026And Then We Held Hands, created at the 2014 Malta Global Game Jam by David Chircop (an institute graduate) and Yannick Massa, went on to win the Golden Geek Best Print and Play Board Game category at the Golden Geek Awards.\nThe global event carries the tagline \u201cinnovation, experimentation and collaboration\u201d, three important pillars of the games industry that are endorsed by the institute.\n\u201cWe want our students to do more than just fit into the game-making \u2018factory\u2019, we want our students to push the boundaries and think critically about every game design decision,\u201d said Mr Schellekens.\n\u201cThe games made at the jam are not for commercial release, which is an excellent opportunity to experiment and innovate without fear of the bottom line. It is also crucial that our students are able to be a productive part of a game design team.\u201d\n\nStudents may also get involved in all the production steps, show their potential and add a project to their portfolio. Besides, the jam provides a valuable reality check.\n\u201cGame designers often have epic plans in mind for their game but epic plans require epic budgets and other tools and resources that may not be available, so the constraints placed by the game jam can teach the students where they can cut and what they need to keep,\u201d noted Mr Schellekens.\u00a0\nWe want our students to push the boundaries and think critically\nThe institute stays open round the clock during the jam, with staff members and volunteers on site. Participants can avail themselves of workstations with game-making software installed and can browse a board game and a video game library for inspiration. Soft drinks, water, snacks and a lot of fruit \u201cto keep jammers\u2019 brains at peak performance\u201d are also supplied.\u00a0\nMr Schellekens emphasised that the jam is not a competition but more of a social event, where the focus is on the experience and having fun.\u00a0\nSo, what happens to the end products?\n\u201cWe\u2019ll play them! During the jam there is a part dedicated to try out everyone\u2019s games. The full code is also uploaded on the Malta Global Game Jam website, so people can download the games. Some teams choose to develop their ideas further such as\u2026And Then We Held Hands team, some may use games in their portfolio, others may just leave it aside as a lesson learned.\u201d\nWhatever the outcome, the game jam provides a great challenge and experience, ensured Mr Schellekens.\n\u201cIt is almost always a guarantee that you will come out of a game jam more tired but better than you were before.

The Federation of Underwater Activities Malta together with the Professional Diving Schools Association said the notice could have been extended to include some 10 other wrecks, as well as other historical or underwater attractions, giving them better protection.
