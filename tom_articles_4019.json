The Corinthia Group defended its plans for the St George Bay development on Monday and denied some claims being made about it.\nThe group issued a statement in the wake of media reports and statements by environment NGOs.\nEarlier, Moviment Graffitti hit out at a proposed deal between the government and the group, which it said would mean giving away public land \u201cfor a pittance\u201d.Describing the proposed deal as \u201cintrinsically wrong on every level\u201d, the group said in a statement on Monday that the land would be used \u201cfor a monstrous project that will have a disastrous impact on people and the environment\u201d.According to a still unpublished draft deed, the Corinthia Group has been awarded the whole of the St George\u2019s Bay peninsula for at least 99 years at a fraction of current market prices, as well as the seabed for land reclamation.Corinthia will pay a premium of \u20ac17 million for the land, a figure which has drawn criticism from industry figures, and plan to build 100,000 square metres of commercial and residential real estate and offices.Moviment Graffitti said the deal meant Corinthia would be making hundreds of millions by selling apartments on land they had got \u201cpractically for free\u201d, which they described as a \u201cblatant case of land theft by big business from the people\u201d.This will destroy large parts of the seabed and close public access to a significant portion of the foreshoreThe NGO also referred to reports that the project would include 12 towers with more than 500 apartments, three times the amount of the recently-approved City Centre project on the nearby Institute of Tourism Studies site.\u201cThis will clearly have a deleterious impact on the coast and Natura 2000 sites, and it will bury alive residents in the surrounding localities under traffic, pollution, noise and intensive commercial activity,\u201d Moviment Graffitti said. \u201cIt would also destroy large parts of the seabed through land reclamation and close public access to a significant portion of the foreshore.\u201d Moviment Graffitti noted that the local plan would have to be amended to allow the development to be approved, and that a master plan for the broader area was still nowhere to be seen despite repeated promises.It accused the authorities of implementing a \u201csecret masterplan\u201d, circumventing normal channels, in light of the several massive projects in the area.\u201cThis is a masterplan that fully transforms that area in a gold-mine for the very wealthy, and completely ignores quality of life considerations and environmental protection,\u201d the NGO said.\nIn a separate statement, NGO Flimkien g\u0127al Ambjent A\u0127jar maintained that the transfer of yet another vast area of prime real estate in the area, to a private enterprise raised many social, environmental and economic concerns.\n\"In the first place the area was conceded to the group specifically for tourism purpose, supposedly to improve the tourism product, create long-term employment, and benefit the public good,\" the group said.\u00a0\nCorinthia explains: deal is about change of use of land\nIn its reaction, the Corinthia said it already holds long-term exclusive rights to the land.\n\"The draft agreement with Government covers solely contractual terms for the restatement of our existing ownership rights to the land in St George\u2019s Bay, nothing more. The draft limits us to potentially developing a maximum of 100,000m2 of commercial and residential areas, besides an obligation to develop two new luxury hotels. This limitation should be also be read in relation to the floor areas we are currently allowed to develop under current planning rules.\" the group said.\n\"The contract therefore, is about terms and conditions stipulating maximum limitations and not about architectural plans, of which there are none in our proposed agreement with government, as these will be developed over the years to come in a series of phases and subject always to planning rules and consent.\"\nThe group insisted that certain visuals presenting several high-rise buildings crammed next to one another on the St George\u2019s peninsula were misleading.\n\"They certainly do not represent our plans, or our track record in developing landmark, balanced projects in Malta and overseas. They cannot therefore serve as a reference for an informed debate.\nWith regard to claims on the number of serviced residences which will be developed on this site, the company said that subject to the draft agreement, actual architectural plans have been prepared for the proposed phase one (picture), and these will be discussed with the relevant regulatory and planning authorities in due course.\n\"Our aim here, in this first phase, is to entirely redevelop the Corinthia Hotel into Malta\u2019s foremost luxury property together with extensive landscaped gardens and amenities. In parallel, we are aiming to develop two luxury serviced residential blocks, the highest proposed to be 15 floors, on land located between the current Corinthia and Radisson hotels. In total, these blocks will accommodate 90 apartments that have been designed to a standard that would make them competitive internationally and therefore make Corinthia the forerunner in this sector in Malta.\n\"What will happen beyond will depend on many factors, including economic viability, planning considerations, and so much more, but above all, a commitment of ensuring a beautiful development of six-star standard supporting our new Corinthia hotel.\u00a0\n12 towers proposal 'outdated volume study'\nWith regard to claims that the company intends to develop 12 towers, the highest of which will be 21 floors, the company said the master plan being presented on some local newspapers was an outdated volume study, one of many which was prepared in the past years, in order to analyze the different possibilities.\n\"Currently the company only has plans to redevelop the Corinthia Hotel into Malta\u2019s foremost luxury property and develop two luxury serviced residential blocks. Our intentions remain for the vast majority of our land will remain open and landscaped, indeed the majority of the land will remain unbuilt as this is cardinal to achieve our six-star standard. In itself, this clearly demonstrates our intentions to maintain a balanced, holistic environment to our proposed luxury hotels and serviced residences.\nNo land reclamation\nThe group also insisted it has no intention of pursuing land reclamation. \"We understand the proposed clause in our draft agreement is standard to similar agreements across Malta. However, we repeat, that we do not intend to pursue any land reclamation as part of our project and consequently this concern is a non-starter,\" it said.", "comment_count": 24, "id": 3423}, {"keywords": "", "author": "Sarah Carabott", "article_body": "Organ donors leave behind relatives who need all the support they can get, especially when they keep thinking about the physical remains of their loved ones, the parents of a 20-year-old donor say.\nDrew Abela passed away suddenly after suffering a brain haemorrhage in summer 2016.

Moreover, in homes where violence is used, there tend to be other forms of abuse also taking place, such as emotional abuse or neglect.\n\u201cChildren who are not given the love, safety and care needed come to believe that they\u2019re not loveable, that they are unworthy and that their needs will not be met. If not addressed, this extends into adulthood,\u201d she says.\nThe repercussions of such a situation can be quite wide-ranging.\n\u201cWhen children experience and witness violence, some learn that this is the only way to deal with conflict, causing them to use violence in their own relationships as adults. Some adult survivors, on the other hand, move towards relationships where once again they\u2019re re-traumatised, seeking out people who are violent or abusive towards them.\u201d\nShe explains that a great deal of research has been carried out on the long-term effects of violence, and it has been shown that adults with a history of child abuse are more likely than the general population to experience physical health problems.\u00a0\n\u201cMental health problems associated with past histories of child abuse include personality disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, dissociative disorders, depression, anxiety disorders and addiction,\u201d she continues.\nHer advice to those who have experienced violence and abuse in childhood is to seek psychotherapy or counselling, in order to have a space to discuss what\u2019s happening in their lives in the present day, in terms of issues they may be having in relationships, at work and so forth.\n\u201cAlthough it may be a painful process, counselling allows them to express their sadness, pain and anger at what happened to them as children in the supportive, accepting environment of the therapy room.\u00a0 In therapy, people can express emotions they\u2019ve never felt able to express, and work through the emotions related to their traumatic experiences.\n\u201cSlowly, they can learn to move through their pain and hurt and begin to develop more healthy coping mechanisms, have healthier relationships, and build the self-esteem and self-love that was damaged by their earlier experiences.\u201d", "comment_count": 20, "id": 3451}, {"keywords": "", "author": "Ivan Camilleri", "article_body": "The government has granted unlimited rights to the Corinthia Group to reclaim the seabed around the peninsula it occupies at St George\u2019s Bay and build on it.\nAccording to a still unpublished draft deed, negotiated by Tourism Minister Konrad Mizzi, the Corinthia Group has been awarded the whole of the St George\u2019s Bay peninsula for at least 99 years at a fraction of current market prices, to use not just for hotels but also for speculation.\nNow, The Sunday Times of Malta can also reveal that the government has conceded to let the group reclaim the seabed surrounding the whole peninsula.\nAccording to the draft deed, which has still to be approved by Parliament and signed, the Corinthia Group can then use the newly claimed land to build apartments, offices and retail space for purely commercial purposes.\nThe draft contract does not impose any sort of limitation to how much of the seabed the hotel group will be allowed to reclaim.

Prof. Aquilina said the argument could be made that the judge \u201cexpected a more onerous level of proof from Dr Busuttil than that expected from the Commissioner of Police or the Attorney General\u201d.\n\u201cOf course, the police and the AG have resources at their disposal which an MP surely does not enjoy. However, the judge is bound by law and if the law places a more onerous burden on the public than it does on the police or the AG, it is not up to the judge to change the law but to implement it, more so when the law is clear.\u201d\nAsked whether the judge was right to doubt the legality of the Panama Papers leak, he said that according to the Criminal Code, the offence needed to be identified by the complainant and unless this information is provided the inquiring magistrate cannot carry out \u201ca fishing expedition\u201d to see whether someone has committed the offence.\nIt is better to have no remedy at law than a travesty of justice!\n\u201cWhile reference to the Panama Papers is material to such an inquiry, the evidence which has to be produced is the best evidence rather than documents which are unauthenticated as they derived from leaks from Mossack Fonseca servers.\n\u201cI do understand that the consequences of this \u2013 willed by the law \u2013 is that it places the complainant in a Catch-22 situation, more so if the complainant is not a whistleblower privy to the necessary documentation to make his/her case,\u201d Prof. Aquilina said.\nIn an article on his blog last week called \u2018Judge Grixti\u2019s Catch-22\u2019, lawyer Jacques Rene Zammit wrote: \u201cYou need an in genere inquiry to investigate, find and confirm the existence of proof that may be used for a future prosecution of a crime.

It\u2019s getting to the point where many farmers are just giving up,\u201d he said.\u00a0\nThe problem they face is pretty straightforward: foreign pork is far cheaper to produce than it is on Malta because farmers here have to shell out a bomb to import the cereal feeds that fattens pigs before slaughter.\nMaltese farm operations are also tiny compared to the mammoth factory-scale farms on the mainland, meaning the cost per pig here is much higher than it is for Dutch farmers to rear a sow.\u00a0\u00a0\nMeanwhile, many local sellers are opting for the cheaper foreign produce as profit margins on these products are higher.\nLocal supermarket fridges and butcher displays are being stuffed with foreign roasts, chops and sausages, but sold to consumers at the same price as Maltese pork.\n\u201cSo you see the cheaper imports aren\u2019t translating into savings for the consumer, if anything consumers are opting for more expensive products such as pre-packaged, marinated or pre-cooked products,\u201d Dr Frendo said. To make matters worse for local farmers, a minority of unscrupulous sellers have started flogging foreign meat as local to cash in on buyers\u2019 preference for Maltese products.\nLifelong farmer Mario Abela yesterday walked around his \u017bebbug farm, distraught.\n\u201cIt\u2019s basically over for the sector. I don\u2019t know how we are going to keep going on like this,\u201d he said.\u00a0\nThe president of the pig farmer\u2019s cooperative, Mr Abela said the situation was so bad that other farmers were turning to the cooperative for bridge loans just to be able to cover operating costs.\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s left for us. It is too hard to keep fighting on when the situation keeps getting worse and worse and no one seems to care about Maltese pig farmers,\u201d he said.\nLosing the market\nPrior to joining the EU, practically all the pork sold on the island was local \u2013 in fact, you would have been hard pressed, Dr Frendo says, to find foreign pork in Malta at all.\nWhile pig farmers in Malta used to sell around 2,300 pigs every week in 2004 \u2013 making up more than 90 per cent of the market share \u2013 last year they sold fewer than 1,000 carcasses weekly, despite increased consumption on the island. The result? A dwindling market share of less than 30 per cent for Maltese producers, with a number of pig farms closing down in recent years.\nIt\u2019s basically over for the sector. I don\u2019t know how we are going to keep going on like this\nBack in 2016 farmers issued a statement pleading with consumers to buy local.\nEuropean pork prices dropped suddenly that year and have remained low ever since, leading to a flooding of imported foreign pork on the island.\n\u201cAt this point, any further reduction in sales for farmers may cause the entire sector to become non-viable, risking the livelihoods of hundreds of local families,\u201d the farmers had said.\nFood fraud\nThe local cooperative of farmers had tried to protect and promote their locally grown produce when they came out with a labelling system to help consumers make informed choices.\nPork with the \u2018Majjal ta\u2019 Malta\u2019 label was meant to be local, ethical and sustainable produce, or so consumers thought.\nDr Frendo said the cooperative had released thousands of labels and stickers to distributors and sellers, however they had serious concerns that their inability to audit the system left it open to abuse and fraud.\u00a0\nFarmers also complained of a situation where foreign-imported, mass-produced pork was being falsely labelled and sold as Maltese local produce. However it was unclear how widespread this practice was.\nDr Frendo said the matter had been raised with the authorities but little or no action had been taken.\nMeanwhile, a new problem facing the sector was that of some sellers importing live pigs, only to slaughter them the next day and claim they were Maltese produce.\nWhy eat local?\nThe argument for locally grown pork is the same you\u2019d hear any \u2018eat local\u2019 lobby say: food grown in smaller batches is more ethically produced and helps support local communities.\nDr Frendo said that Maltese family-run pork farms had relatively small numbers of swine compared to the factory-farms on mainland Europe.\nBut supporting the Maltese pork industry would also indirectly support other farmers too.\nDr Frendo said the cereal feeds imported to grow Maltese pigs were the same used to feed dairy cows and poultry.\nIf pig farmers decided to call it quits, other farms would have to bear the cost of importing feed, raising production costs. Pig farmers, he said, would just be the first domino to fall.\nLocal producers, Dr Frendo said, depended on consumers for their survival.\u00a0\nA last ditch solution\nThere is still hope for the sector. Dr Frendo said the pig farmers\u2019 cooperative planned to try what dairy farmers had done to protect their trade.\u00a0\n\u201cJust as the Maltese dairy farmers market their product under the Benna brand to maintain reasonable control of their supply chain, we want to market more of the Maltese pig farmers\u2019 products in a way that we can guarantee that the product really is local,\u201d he said.\u00a0\nWhile there were also other things like EU funds and government intervention that could help save the industry, farmers were hoping a recognisable local brand would help keep them afloat.", "comment_count": 40, "id": 3458}, {"keywords": "", "author": "Anthony Manduca", "article_body": "A \u201crule-of-law control system\u201d must be introduced in the Constitution, the Democratic Party has proposed.\n\u201cSuch a system would constrain abuses of power, ensure equal treatment of citizens and ensure public interest,\u201d the party says in one of its 12 key proposals for constitutional reform.\nPresenting the PD\u2019s proposals to President Marie-Louise Coleiro Preca last week, party leader Godfrey Farrugia said that the drafting of the new Constitution should be left to experts in the field, both local and foreign.\nThe PD\u2019s other proposals are:\nParliament\u2019s ability to override the Constitution must end.

The aim was to make reading fun by integrating spaces and activities that involve sensory stimulation and encouraging learners to engage, explore, connect and learn.\nAt the same time the project sought to adhere to the principles of education for sustainable development by reusing tons of strong cardboard and other waste, including some hazardous waste, which could have otherwise been thrown away.\nThe author (left) with school head Dr A. Pulis.\nDuring the summer months new interactive whiteboards had been installed, leaving the school with around 35 large strong cardboard boxes \u2013 weighing 210 kilograms \u2013 to dispose of. But instead of disposing this high-grade packaging material, the thick cardboard was reused to create a sensory wall and book cases.\nThe project served as an outreach to the whole school community, involving parents, educators and young students, and during the European Week for Waste Reduction last November parents and educators were invited to bring over cans of leftover paint to be used to decorate the cardboard furniture and walls. They also brought in bits of leftover cloths, buttons, zips, wool and other textured materials that were recycled to set up the sensory wall and to furnish the room with cushions made from used material.\nThe design of the detoxifying reading hub involved consultations with professionals such as occupational therapists and inclusion coordinators working with children who would especially benefit from such a sensory input. Sensory stimulation not only benefits particular students who may face self-regulation challenges, but enhances the reading and learning experience for all. By integrating sensory stimulation in the design of this reading space, the school sought to meet the needs of all students.\nThe project was the fruit of all stakeholders in the project: educators and students helped with the artistic creation of the murals and decorations, parent volunteers and neighbours from the community worked on the recycled furniture and soft furnishings, and professionals from the Occupational Therapy department worked on the sensory wall. The school handymen also gave a helping hand in the realisation of the project.\nThe school believes that the project will: foster a culture of reading in the school; improve student outcomes and raise achievement; improve the general well-being of the pupils; create independent readers and readers for life and give all learners more opportunities for learning.\nFurthermore, through the project we wanted to foster a \u2018second chance\u2019 mentality in school community. The overall feeling of all participants can be summarised in this quote by one of the parent helpers: \u201cI never imagined that with some creativity and great teamwork, things we usually throw away can be turned into resources for little children\u2026 I feel proud to have had the chance to participate.\u201d\nBernadette Mercieca is assistant head at Mosta Primary A school.", "comment_count": 0, "id": 3476}, {"keywords": "Gozo", "author": "", "article_body": "The 10th edition of Bethlehem f\u2019G\u0127ajnsielem came to a close last Sunday with the arrival of the Three Wise Men.

proceedings, a different reality emerged, based upon evidence put forward by the applicant during his testimony in court as well as in the form of transcribed extracts taken from a secretly recorded

the alleged corruption linked to the scandal.\nFaced with this request, Mr Grech had urged Chris Farrugia to take all data, retrieved from his uncle\u2019s office computer, to the police \u201cso that
