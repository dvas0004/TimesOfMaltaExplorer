He wants to explain why after six years of profits, the Water Services Corporation still needs a government subvention, and that it is going to go up yet again next year, from \u20ac17.2 million to \u20ac19.3 million, even though the corporation had a record turn-over.\nThe issue is not water production but the cost of providing drainage, for which people are not directly charged, as well as the various environmental services provided by the corporation.\n\u201cWe do not make a loss on the production of water \u2013 in spite of the fact that the tariffs are socially engineered to encourage lower usage,\u201d the CEO told The Sunday Times of Malta.\nThe corporation, which until 2003 had only provided and distributed water, had taken over the Drainage Department pretty much lock, stock and barrel. And the costs there have been getting higher and higher, reaching about \u20ac18 million a year.\nThis is because treatment of the sewage has become much more expensive since EU accession dramatically raised the standards. Sewage treatment is also, Mr Bilocca stressed, a very energy-intensive process.\u00a0Actually, the \u20ac8.2 million was what we achieved. The estimate for the year had been \u20ac1.4 million\n\u201cIf we were to add up all the services that we provide over and above tap water and sewage, you will probably find that the subvention should be even greater!\u201d\nThe CEO took over in 2017 \u2013 the sixth appointee since Labour came to power \u2013 facing doubts over whether he would succeed in improving the situation.\nHe has overhauled the \u201cvery fragmented\u201d hierarchy, which before consisted of seven directorates. \u201cWe have a much more logical structure now, with directorates far better defined to ensure more seamless operations and to remove the silo effect.\u201d\nThe corporation has a headcount over 1,100 \u2013 with 222 people added before the general election in 2017. This pushed the wage bill up and it now represents 33 per cent of costs, from 29 per cent in 2015.\nHe insisted all the staff are being \u201cfully deployed\u201d, with some areas where resources are actually stretched.\n\u201cWe now have a much more dynamic workforce,\u201d he said, adding that training was the key.\nVideo: Mark Zammit Cordina\nThe WSC\u2019s annual report, recently presented to Parliament, said the estimated operational profits for 2019 were down to a \u20ac3.4 million from the \u20ac8.2 million reported for last year.\nHe smiled: \u201cActually, the \u20ac8.2 million was what we achieved. The estimate for the year had been \u20ac1.4 million. And next year\u2019s should also be just a projection. We did better than forecast\u2026\n\u201cHaving said that, we are ploughing considerably more money into improvements and we have unprecedented levels of expenses to cover not only maintenance on crucial sites but also capital expenditure.\n\u201cWe certainly do not need to review our tariffs. However, instead of passing the savings that result from better efficiency on to the consumer in a monetary way, we are doing it by passing them on as improved service.\u201d\nFive facts about water supply\n\u25a0 The Water Services Corporation employs 1,100 people, representing 33 per cent of its costs.\n\u25a0 It made a profit of \u20ac8.2 million last year.\n\u25a0 50 dispensers of treated sewage water have been installed in agricultural areas, with the figure set to rise to 400.\n\u25a0 Reverse osmosis water is slightly acidic, so it has to be treated with alkaline before being distributed.\n\u25a0 Some reverse osmosis water is blended with 40 per cent groundwater.\nWater production has come down drastically since 1995 because leakages \u2013 which used to account for 60 per cent of production \u2013 are now so low.\nPlugging those leaks\nThe corporation is tackling water production on various fronts. The first one \u2013 and arguably an environmental priority \u2013 is to reduce the depletion of groundwater before the situation becomes irreversible.\nOne measure is to provide farmers with an alternative, particularly since they cannot use chlorinated water: so-called \u2018new\u2019 water. Once sewage has been treated \u2013 to just short of the fully potable \u2018gold\u2019 standard \u2013 it is being made available via dispensers placed in agricultural areas: 50 so far, with the intention of increasing them to 400.\n\u201cRather than pumping treated water into the sea and losing it, this can be used for agriculture \u2013 even on raw crops like lettuce and strawberries!\u201d he said, noting that seven billion litres per year were available.\nThe government is encouraging take-up by offering the first consumption band free of charge (reimbursed to the corporation by the government), followed by a progressive tariff.\n\u201cThis has been a tremendous success with very good take-up in spite of initial reluctance.\u201d\nWith regard to potable water, one of the main thrusts over the past decade or two has been reducing leaks, which used to account for some 60 per cent of all the production. Overall production is now half what it was in 1995, in spite of the burgeoning demand, all thanks to the dramatic reductions in lost water.\nMr Bilocca said the leakages are now so low that it costs as much to tackle them as the lost water itself costs, although there was no room for complacency.\nWith a rapidly growing population, the corporation is keeping an eye on trends. It has projections on demand up till 2050.\nThe capacity of the Maltese reverse osmosis plants is increasing, but he described the new one on Gozo \u2013 which will produce six million litres a day, with a capacity of nine million \u2013 as a \u201cgame changer\u201d. The island, he pointed out, had been left for a whole week and a half reliant on groundwater because the undersea cable that linked it to Malta was damaged by February storm.\nAnother priority is to reduce the energy required by the reverse osmosis plants, which was 10kWh per 1,000 litres in the 1990s and is now 2.8kWh.\nWhy are we still drinking bottled water?\nWSC CEO Richard Bilocca hopes that tap water will be good enough for drinking within the next two years.\nMr Bilocca caught us looking at the bottle of water on his desk and cringed.\n\u201cIt\u2019s embarrassing, I know. I cannot drink from my tap here in Luqa! But things are changing,\u201d he said.\nThe problems with tap water are somewhat technical. Pure reverse osmosis water is slightly acidic, so the supply to places like Pembroke and Sliema \u2013 which get it direct from the RO plant \u2013 is treated with alkaline chemicals, as it would otherwise eat away the pipes. Other areas have it blended with groundwater, in a 60-40 per cent ratio. The groundwater will be reduced to 30 per cent in the near future.\nThe corporation is tackling this in two ways: fibreglass pipes which are corrosion-resistant and a blending plant at Ta\u2019 Qali. This is fed by tunnels from four directions, which will allow all the RO water to be blended, diluting the salt from the groundwater and meaning no alkaline chemicals are required.\nWithin two years, Mr Bilocca hopes that the bottle on his desk will no longer be needed.\n\u201cWe already provide water. Now we are focusing on making the experience more pleasurable, because people deserve it.\n\u201cAn improvement in water is an improvement in the quality of life. Just ask the mother of a young child or an elderly person who has to lug around six-packs of bottled water! Never mind the impact of the plastic on the environment. Whatever it takes we are going to do it.\u201d", "comment_count": 10, "id": 1419}, {"keywords": "", "author": "", "article_body": "During searches in several localities, by Customs Enforcement Officials, 6,956 bottles of wine and 740 plastic bags on which excise duty had not been paid were seized by Customs.The items were found in various outlets when officials were carrying out routine searches in Sliema, San \u0120wann, Tal-Ibra\u0121, St Paul's Bay, Bu\u0121ibba, Qawra, Mosta, Balzan, Birkirkara, Mrie\u0127el, Qormi, \u0126al Far, Marsaxlokk, Marsascala, Fgura and Senglea.The Customs Department\u2019s Enforcement Unit has been clamping down on the sale of illicit goods, in an effort to hamper contraband operations and collect the taxes owed, which is being charged to the end consumer.", "comment_count": 3, "id": 1420}, {"keywords": "", "author": "Vanessa Macdonald", "article_body": "Her teenage son could have lived had adequate safety measures been implemented on the boat he was on before jumping overboard to his death two years ago, a mother argued in court.\nJulian Quatresous and five of his friends had leapt off the Fernandes II in mid-August 2017 as it cruised past Paceville on its way back from Comino, thinking they would save time and swim ashore rather than go all the way back to the boat\u2019s berth in Sliema.\n\u201cAt a certain moment, we recognised the great tower at St Julian\u2019s, which is very close to the night clubs. At a glance it didn\u2019t seem that far away,\u201d his friend, Louis, said in an affidavit presented in court.\nHis family has taken the boat owners, Captain Morgan Submarine Ltd, to court, saying the young Frenchman\u2019s death was the result of their negligence and their failure to abide by rules and regulations, both with regard to maritime law and also to health and safety. The case is being heard by Mr Justice Lawrence Mintoff. The magisterial inquiry into the fatality has not been concluded yet.\nDocuments submitted in court give a heart-breaking account of the hour the teenagers spent in the sea after they jumped off the boat at about 1am.\nJulian Quatresous had wanted to join the merchant navy.\nIt seems the leap was not pre-planned: one of the boys, Pierre Antoine, jumped and others followed, leaving one of the others asleep on board. It was only when they were in the sea, fully dressed, that they realised the shore was much further than it had seemed and the waves much harder to deal with.\nThey started calling out but lost sight of each other several times.\n\u201cI heard someone panicking and swam towards him. Among these cries of panic, I heard Julian asking where we were. He did not seem to be in difficulty\u2026 I found Pierre Antoine, who was drowning, in front of me. Louis joined us and we brought Pierre Antoine to his senses,\u201d another of the boys, Hugo, said.\n\u201cI heard Raphael shout the first name of Julian three or four times\u2026 I thought that Raphael and Julian were both swimming. I was not worried about them as they were both used to the water,\u201d he recalled.\nAfter about a quarter of an hour, they could see rescue boats and a helicopter but realised they had not been spotted and continued trying to swim to shore.\nIt was only some 45 minutes later that three of them were picked up by rescuers and taken to the Armed Forces of Malta maritime base where they found two of the others who had been picked up from the beach.\nHugo was the first to be picked up by a patrol boat and he guided it to where he thought the others were but it was only when they were picked up that they realised Julian was not with them.\n\u201cAs he got into the boat, Raphael was sobbing and told me that they had lost Julian,\u201d he said.\nAs the hours passed with no news of him, they realised that they had to tell Julian\u2019s family about his disappearance.\nHis mother flew in from France with her sister and other son the following Sunday. They were still hoping for the best and set up teams, having someone at the apartment all the time in case Julian showed up.\nThe days passed and their worst fears were eventually confirmed when Julian\u2019s body was found by divers. He was just a few months short of 20 and was due to start his studies at the National Maritime School, in Marseilles that September.\nThe friends\u2019 affidavits gave some insight into the situation on board the boat.\nThe sea had already been choppy when they set off, with a friend saying: \u201cThe boat was rolling a lot and you had to hold on in order to move without falling over.\u201d\nPierre Antoine said in his affidavit he had only seen one security guard on board (his friend Hugo said there were two) and that, even so, the guard was only concerned with making sure that only those with VIP tickets got into the reserved area.\nOne of the friends said there had been about 200 people on board for the event organised by Lazy Pirate. A few of them said they had not been given any safety briefing and that they could see no safety equipment.\nIn her affidavit, Julian\u2019s mother, Christine, said she bought a ticket and went on the Fernandes II herself the Saturday following her son\u2019s death, wanting to see for herself what kind of party it was.\nShe said that although the tickets were verified on boarding, none of the youngsters were asked about their age even though it was to be an open bar. She said she saw no headcount being taken either as they boarded the boat nor once she sailed off, nor when the boat left the swimming stop at Comino, even though a number of passengers had swum out of the area illuminated up by the boat\u2019s floodlight.\nSome of Julian\u2019s friends gave similar accounts in their affidavits.\nAlthough she could not recall whether there had been a safety briefing, the mother said there were no life jackets visible, nor any cabinets where they could have been stowed.\n\u201cI believe that if the crew members were sufficiently responsible and if there had been more of them to ensure better surveillance and adequate security measures during these parties, my son could have been spared from his tragic death,\u201d she declared in her affidavit forming part of the records of the case.\nCaptain Morgan Submarine denies all accusations.\nIt pointed out that the boat had been chartered to the party organiser, Lazy Pirate, though it had earlier declined to pass a copy of the charter agreement to the family\u2019s lawyers.\nThe company said the incident was due to the victim\u2019s negligence, recklessness and his failure to follow regulations.\nThe legal team representing the family is headed by lawyer Cedric Mifsud.", "comment_count": 0, "id": 1421}, {"keywords": "", "author": "", "article_body": "These are the stories which made it to the front pages of Monday's newspapers:\nThe Times of Malta leads with a follow-up to the 2017 tragedy when a French teenager had drowned after jumping off the Fernandes II to swim to shore.

It shifts to seven men to three women.\nHowever, the number of girls aged 17 and under is still double that of men, exposing a higher risk among women at this vulnerable age.\nThere is no gender difference between the ages of 18 and 29 but the risk among men increases after the age of 30.\n\u201cThis means that while men are more at risk of completed suicide, when it comes to people who are referred or admitted for care, the scenario is completely different.\n\u201cThe figures tally with general psychiatry data: we normally see four women for every six men with acute psychiatric problems. Therefore, we need to understand better what triggers a situation that sees many more men dying by suicide.\u201d\nDr Cachia called on fellow stakeholders to break the silence on suicide and suicidal thoughts, particularly when it comes to mood, anxiety and stress-related disorders.\nHe recommended looking at suicidal intent and attempts across all inpatient acute psychiatric admissions, which would include voluntary admissions for psychiatric care in Mater Dei Hospital, Mount Carmel Hospital and the Gozo Hospital.\nPatterns discovered from such data could help set off alarm bells for any professional who comes in contact with distressed people, possibly even narrowing down risks by gender and age, he added.\nThe MAP conference will be held on June 13 and 14.

When the gap in votes is very great it is also clear that the problem is not only organisational but that there are personality and policy issues too.\nThe Labour Party has just won two large electoral victories \u2013 that for members of the European Parliament with a 16% advantage over the Nationalist Party and that for local councillors with an 18% advantage. Labour is quite rightly celebrating but its leaders will be admitting privately that the size of the victories was also due to what the PN voter base decided to do last week. A sizable minority reached the conclusion that it was more important to send a message to the PN leader, secretary general, executive committee and general council than to fully challenge Labour.\nAnd their message was simple, they do not believe that today\u2019s Nationalist Party can win a general election. To long-serving supporters like me, this is a very bitter pill to have to swallow but swallow it we must. We can only be grateful that the PN voter base respects the Nationalist Party enough to tell it to get its house in order rather than just writing it off once and for all at the next general election.\nThe party must now show that it has heard the message, understood it and is totally committed to change whatever needs to be changed, starting immediately. There can be no \u2018business as usual\u2019. There can be no delays. There can be no sacred cows. Furthermore, the eventual solutions are not going to come from the past but from the future and anyone who wishes to move the clock back, either in terms of personalities or policies, has to understand that they are part of the problem.\u201d\n\n\u2018The PN must redefine some of its basic policies\u2019\nJoe FriggieriProfessor of Philosophy, University of Malta, former PN MEP candidate\n\u201cFollowing its crushing defeat at the polls, the Nationalist Party must redefine some of its basic policies in order to make itself re-electable. And it must do this whether or not it decides to change its leader. Let me mention a number of areas where I think such rethinking is necessary.\nIn a climate of economic prosperity and negligible unemployment, the PN must show that whatever changes to the government\u2019s economic model it intends to introduce will produce roughly the same rate of economic growth while ensuring a fairer and more equitable distribution of wealth. Above all, it will need to convince the large swathes of Labour voters in Labour strongholds, especially those in the lower income bracket that they will do better if such changes are implemented.\nWhere the environment is concerned, the PN must admit that decisions made in the past by some of its representatives have contributed in no small way to the production of the present state of environmental degradation. It will also need to spell out in no uncertain terms how it intends to stop the rot.\nOne of the main causes of air pollution and respiratory diseases is the huge volume of traffic clogging our roads and emitting poisonous fumes. There will have to be a sea-change in people\u2019s ideas if public transport is ever to replace the private car. Here again, the PN needs to put forward concrete proposals for dealing with the problem \u2013 something it hasn\u2019t done so far with any degree of success.\nThe PN must also make its position clear regarding immigration. Too many conflicting ideas were bandied about during the party\u2019s campaign, and an opportunity was lost to combat racism and promote ways of integrating migrants into the community. This is another issue over which the PN must carry out some radical rethinking in order for its elected representatives to be able to put forward innovative suggestions in European forums whenever the need arises.\nIn a society that has witnessed such a radical transformation from traditional patterns of behaviour to more cosmopolitan life-styles, the PN needs to revamp its means of communication in order to project a more vibrant image of itself to all sectors of the population, especially the young.\u201d\n\n\u2018Conservative, liberal and green forces should group together\u2019\nJoe BorgFormer PN minister and European Commissioner\n\u201cThe latest election result is not so much a Labour victory as it is a PN defeat. The single most determining factor is the large number of voters who did not cast their vote and who are assumed to be largely PN sympathisers, especially since they hail mainly from areas that have traditionally voted for the PN.\nI firmly believe that the party should immediately carry out a deep analysis of the causes behind such an electoral defeat and set a short deadline by when such an analysis should be finalised and made public. I also believe that the party leader should himself pledge to seek a vote of confidence from the highest organ within the party, the General Council, immediately after the results of the analysis are out.\nThe whole process needs to be over and done with by the end of this year if there is to be a decent chance for the party and its leader, whether it is Dr Delia or someone new, to achieve an electoral success in 2022.\nI also believe that serious consideration should be given to the formation of alliances that group together conservative, liberal and green forces under one overarching structure. In this way the prospects for an alternative governing majority become much more real.\u201d\nThese are excerpts from Joe Borg\u2019s article.\n\n\u2018The party is coming across as a collection of amateurish prima donnas\u2019\nMichael FalzonFormer PN minister\n\u201cFirst of all, the factions within the PN should tread carefully and avoid knee jerk reactions at all costs. Alas, for some this advice is already too late!\nSecondly everybody in the PN should swallow their pride and forget their pet hates and concentrate on the job of behaving like a responsible party in Opposition \u2013 rather than bickering about whatever they disagree about within the PN itself. The party is coming across as a collection of amateurish prima donnas trying to outdo each other by loudly repeating the same ineffective mantras. This nonsense has to stop.\nThe PN is facing a dilemma: removing Adrian Delia will only serve to increase the anger of the grassroots that elected him PN leader while keeping him is seen as an \u2018affront\u2019 of those who fought tooth and nail against his bid \u2013 and lost.\nThe solution does not lie in changing the leader but in everybody coming to their senses and realise why the PN is losing ground \u2013 not to the Labour Party this time but because many PN supporters did not bother to vote.\nThe PN election campaign was amateurish and did not transmit a clear message as to why people should choose to vote for PN candidates. But now the PN should look forward rather than waste time on recriminations.\nThe PN should start thinking of preparing for an intelligent electoral campaign in three years\u2019 time and for this it certainly needs expert advice. They have to start working on this now, in spite of the fact that in the last 15 years the party\u2019s finances went from bad to worse to shambolic.\u201d\n\n\u2018Adrian Delia should resign\u2019\nLaurence GrechFormer editor, The Sunday Times of Malta\n\u201cDespite his best efforts, Nationalist Party leader Adrian Delia has failed to stem his party\u2019s 10-year decline. In last week\u2019s European Parliament elections, the party declined further, to reach a nadir not seen since 1951.\nThe local election results, of which the loss of Valletta was the most symbolic, rubbed more salt into the PN\u2019s wounds.\nDelia not only failed to convince thousands of Nationalist-leaning voters, who preferred to stay at home, but also failed to make any inroads among Labour sympathisers and newly enfranchised young voters. I am sure, too, that a few PN sympathisers this time gave their first preference to third parties.\nPN secretary-general Clyde Puli\u2019s attempts to seek some consolation from the fact that the worst forecasts (a 72,000-vote gap between the two major parties) failed to materialise, since the gap was of \u2018only\u2019 42,600, and Delia\u2019s assertion that the PN is still the second largest party (ahead of Tal-Ajkla?) were pathetic, to say the least, and an insult to PN voters\u2019 intelligence.\nDelia and his supporters correctly argue that he was chosen to lead the PN democratically. Yet the fact remains that, for various reasons, he has not managed to unite the party behind him. Although he insists that his leadership can only really be tested at the next general election, the EP and local councils\u2019 results point to only two alternatives for the PN leader.\nAs has been suggested elsewhere, Delia should resign and the party leadership temporarily entrusted to a veteran, widely respected PN figure until such time as a new leader is elected or, at the very least, Delia should ask for a vote of confidence from the party structures and resign if he does not obtain it convincingly.\nUnless he takes one of these two options, Delia \u2013 and the party he leads \u2013 is bound to take a bigger battering come 2022.\u201d\n\n\u2018The PN needs to determine what it stands for\u2019\nLawrence ZammitChairman of Misco consulting firm\n\u201cThe Nationalist Party needs to stop being angry at the way people vote. The Nationalist Party does not have a right to government; but it has a duty to be a meaningful Opposition and a credible alternative government. Unless it does this, it cannot evaluate objectively the reasons for the result it obtained at the elections for the European Parliament.\nSeeking to depict the results of these elections as \u2018not as bad as we thought they would be\u2019 will only do a disservice to the party members and Malta.\nThe Nationalist Party also needs to determine what it stands for. Unless the PN sets out clearly its vision for the country, it will not be possible for it to engage with the electorate. To set out its vision, it needs to establish what its own aspirations are and then\u00a0engage with Maltese society. The opinion poll published by The Sunday Times of Malta last April indicated clearly that this engagement with the electorate was not present.\u201d\nFormer PN general secretary Joe Saliba was also asked for his opinion on the way forward for the Nationalist Party, but while thanking the newspaper for seeking his views replied: \u201cI prefer to provide my thoughts on the way forward to the party directly, rather than via the media.\u201d", "comment_count": 160, "id": 1438}, {"keywords": "", "author": "", "article_body": "Two passengers were on Saturday found carrying more than \u20ac21,000 in undeclared cash.\nCustoms said the money was found during cash control checks by Customs officials from the anti-money laundering team and the enforcement section.\nBoth passengers were Ivorian nationals and were departing Malta to Istanbul.

We had a number of years when the graphs kept going up,\u201d Raphael Aloisio, from Deloitte, said.\nWhy was the sector facing a tougher reality today? While the study gives a variety of reasons, Mr Aloisio gave a blunt explanation of his own: if supply (of hotels and restaurants) continued to increase at a faster rate than the demand for rooms and tables, then the results would keep going down.\nThe number of permits for hotels being issued had shot up from 15 in 2012 to 119 in 2017, he said, describing this as \u201calarming\u201d.\nHis warning prompted grunts from the hoteliers and restauranteurs gathered for the presentation and was quickly followed by a slight change of tone on Mr Aloisio\u2019s part for industry players not to take any drastic decisions in reaction to these findings.\nTourism Minister Konrad Mizzi took the opportunity to announced that an agreement with alternative accommodation giant Booking.com had just been reached which would ensure that private accommodation providers in Malta would have to register with the Malta Tourism Authority before putting their property on the international website.\nThe authorities, Dr Mizzi said, were also holding talks with Trip Advisor, he said.\nDr Mizzi said new forms of accommodation were a reality that the country could not ignore. In this spirit, the government was developing a 2025 strategy document to help identify ways to help the sector.\nMHRA president Tony Zahra said that \u201cfor every up there is a down\u201d.\nThe island was not going to get any bigger, and perhaps it was time to start directing investors to consider alternative ways of making money than building new hotels.\nHe urged future planning to ensure there were more ups than downs going forward, and said that while land reclamation could double the island's landmass, the sector had to keep its feet on the ground.\nWhat did the Deloitte study find? Mr Aloisio said tourist spending across the board had gone up in the first quarter this year, but only \u201cmarginally\u201d, by 0.3%.\nDuring the first quarter this year, the number of tourists staying in hotels remained at par with the previous year, although the number of guest nights spent in hotels had dropped by 5.5% - with more tourists opting for accommodation alternatives.\nThis shift in accommodation patterns was having a negative effect on the hotel industry, the survey found, with bottom-line profitability now at stake.\nBoth four-star and five-star hotels in Malta were reporting dips in gross operating profits.\nTourists opting for non-traditional accommodation stayed in Malta on average for 9.31 days, up 8.% and almost four days longer than those staying in hotels. The dip in tourists opting for hotels naturally impacted occupancy rates, with the average occupancy dropping from 56.9% to 53.6%.\nAverage room rates were also down, by around 1%, resulting in an overall drop in revenue per room of some 6.3%.\nOn average, hotels registered a significant drop in gross operating profit per available room.\nIn this quarter that profitability figure had hit \u20ac918, that was \u20ac528 lower than in the same period last year, and \u20ac986 lower than in 2017.\nAlternative accommodation, the report says, was hitting the four-star hotel sector the hardest. Room rates for this sector dropped by 2%.\nRestaurants also experience tougher winter\nThe MHRA conducted a survey among 64 Maltese and Gozitan restaurant owners in collaboration with Deloitte to evaluate their performance during the last winter season, which they said was a \u201cmixed bag\u201d.\nMr Aloisio again gave a warning saying that 52 permits for new restaurants had been issued in 2012, but by 2017 this had shot up to 343.\nAccording to the MHRA, participants reported varying results, with nearly half saying they had declining revenues when compared to the previous winter.\nDespite this drop, some areas in Malta managed to register a positive performance. Restaurants in the north central part of Malta and Gozo managed a 3% increase in revenue overall.\nOn the other hand, coastal areas, Valletta, and southern areas registered a negative trend of 4%, 2%, and 6% respectively.\nThe MHRA estimates a slight growth in operating costs of 2.3%.\nPayroll costs climbed by 5.7%, which the association believes could be linked to the recruitment challenges faced by operators in the sector.\nAround 60% of employees in the catering sector are foreigners, the MHRA estimated.\nOverall, some 56% claimed to have had an unsatisfactory winter performance.

This, it added, had an impact on the quality of education being provided.\nBoth the permanent secretary and the Education Ministry were informed about this and on how angry teachers are because the ministry was saying the issue would be addressed while facts continued to prove otherwise, the MUT commented.\nA string of questions on the matter sent to the Education Ministry last week, including what plans were in place to ensure students would not be forced to miss their exams, remained unanswered at the time of writing.

Do you subscribe to views it is at its lowest ebb ever?\nThere is no doubt whatsoever the party is facing a number of challenges that need to be addressed with urgency and courage but also with a strong sense of loyalty towards our values. The party has a duty to the country first and foremost and, therefore, it is expected to perform its duties as a strong Opposition that is able to defend our country\u2019s reputation while offering an economic vision that guarantees continued well-being for everyone.\nWhat are the reasons for the decline the party has suffered since 2003?\nThe party has always had a major political vision that excited and inspired people. It has managed to deliver on all its major promises throughout its history and Malta in 2019 is the Malta that had been designed by the PN and no one else.\nMalta is a successful EU member, with a vibrant economy that encourages the private sector to invest in the island but also to look beyond our shores. We have a younger generation that is today able to benefit from a wide spectrum of education opportunities enhanced by EU opportunities that the Labour Party would have denied them.\nAll of this was the result of some tough decisions that needed to be made. We had to restructure our public and private sector to introduce the euro in 2008. This helped us face the financial and economic crisis between 2008 and 2013 but, even then, tough and very unpopular decisions needed to be made.\nWe were obviously aware that in politics tough decisions often lead to loss of votes, which is exactly what happened. For example, we are criticised for having increased the water and electricity rates but this criticism fails to recognise the fact that the price of oil shot sky-high.\nThe long and short of it is that the decline in popularity for the PN since 2003 was, in part, due to the tough decisions that had to be made. Of course, I am the first to admit that mistakes were committed but the economic results we achieved in tough times together with the high international and European reputation of Malta speak for themselves. Contrast this to today\u2019s state of play.\nWhat are the factors that contributed to the dismal result in Saturday\u2019s European elections, which is the worst since 1951?\nI will not mince my words. The results clearly show that there is a sizeable faction of PN voters who decided to vote in a manner that sends a strong message to the PN\u2019s present leader, his advisers and the party officials. This faction includes voters who decided to abstain from voting.\nAdrian Delia should put his leadership on the line and prove himself to be worthy of the honour to lead the party\nAccepting this as an undisputable fact is fundamental, otherwise the PN will remain unable to regain lost ground. This is evident, especially from the results registered in key stronghold districts that have traditionally supported the PN.\nThis situation reminds me of a similar situation faced by Labour in 1998 when Alfred Sant antagonised a large chunk of Labour voters because of the \u201cMintoff traditur\u201d (Mintoff traitor) issue. The very positive results achieved by the PN at the time, both in the local council elections and the 1998 general election, are again self-evident. This is not the only reason for this 2019 negative result, but it is one of the most important.\nWhat is the way forward for the PN to start regaining ground outside the party walls, within the electorate?\nIn my opinion there are two measures that need to be taken immediately.\nDr Delia needs to go through an exercise that challenges his leadership. If reconfirmed, then everyone needs to close this chapter and focus on strengthening the party\u2019s unity over the next two years.\nThe second \u2013 and, possibly, more important \u2013 challenge is to present the Maltese electorate with an economic vision that guarantees the future well-being of our people but with Malta\u2019s reputation fully reintegrated in the international arena. The PN is the only party that is able to do this.\nDo the right forums exist in the current structure for anybody who would like to express dissent within the party?\nYes, certainly. The issue is not the structure but the courage to stand up and be counted.\nIs there still time for Dr Delia to win the support of his critics even internally or is it too late now? How would you go about it?\nIn politics it is never too late. Back in 2008, all pundits predicted a major loss for the PN in the general election. I won that election by sheer determination and conviction that our policies were the best. But I too made some tough decisions within the party even though they could have put my political career at risk.\nShould Dr Delia resign?\nAdrian Delia should put his leadership on the line and prove himself to be worthy of the honour to lead the party. Whatever people say, he is the legitimate leader of the PN as a result of a democratic process that took place 18 months ago. However, the circumstances today demand that he recognises the present state of affairs and move forward to face the challenge head-on.\nIf he decides to stay, should Dr Delia call for a vote of confidence to gauge his support within the party as you had done in 2012?\nIn 2012, I faced a situation where my leadership was put in doubt. I had an option of resigning or face the challenge. I chose to face the challenge head-on and put my leadership (and, of course, my prime ministership) on the line for the benefit of the party and the country.\nLooking back, I believe it was the right decision as it legitimised my decision to stay on until the end of the legislature, facing the challenges of an economic and financial crisis that saw the economy of larger countries collapse and millions of workers and pensioners suffering as a result.

would examine the need of Constitutional reform.\nIn another amendment, Dr Mallia sought to water down references to Nexia BT accountant Brian Tonna, who is a close friend of the Prime Minister\u2019s chief of staff.\nDr Mallia attempted to replace a paragraph emphasising the \"key role\" played by Mr Tonna and Nexia BT in the Panama Papers, Electrogas, Egrant, Hillman and \u2018golden passports\u2019 affairs and the lack of disciplinary action taken against them by the Accountancy Board.\nThis paragraph highlighted how Mr Tonna and Nexia BT received numerous lucrative government

received government contracts\u201d.\nA series of concerns put forward about the murder investigation by the Council of Europe were also targeted by Dr Mallia.\nDr Mallia demanded the deletion of passages noting serious concerns about the probe, including references to the recusal of magistrate Consuelo Scerri Herrera, the \u201cneed\u201d to remove the former lead police investigator Silvio Valletta from the probe, and the Prime Minister\u2019s removal of inquiring magistrate Anthony Vella by virtue of his promotion to judge.\n\nThese amendments were also rejected.\nReferences to the resignation or dismissal of four police commissioners between 2013 and 2016, and the Prime Minister\u2019s power of appointment were also targeted by Dr Mallia.\nThe Labour MP instead wanted this

matter.\nIt said that the process regarding the motion originally presented by Mr Omtzigt was ongoing and not public.

It prompted a barrage of complaints, including a petition from NGO Flimkien G\u0127al Ambjent A\u0127jar, which has been endorsed by more than 1,700 objectors.\nThe PA had justified the refusal on grounds that the proposal would result in excessive development and have an adverse impact on the garden and palazzo, thus breaching cultural heritage protection policies.\nIn his appeal, the developer noted that an outline development permit had already been issued, meaning the regulator had agreed in principle that deve-lopment could take place.\nIt was also pointed out that scheduling of the property did not preclude any development and, furthermore, the PA had adopted doubled standards because an application on an adjacent property that once formed part of the palazzo had been approved. The plans had also been altered from those filed at outline stage to conform to certain requests.\nThe\u2008PA commented that the outline permit had only been issued in 2011 following an appeal before the same tribunal.
